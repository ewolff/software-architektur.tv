Here's a LinkedIn post teaser for the podcast episode:

🎙️ Excited to share this insightful conversation with Diana Montalion about her new book "Learning Systems Thinking: Essential Non-Linear Skills and Practices for Software Professionals" 

Key takeaways:
• Systems thinking helps us understand how relationships between parts produce effects - whether in code, teams, or organizations
• Small practices like "Yes, and..." acknowledgments and explaining our reasoning can transform how teams work together
• We need both linear and non-linear thinking approaches to build better software systems
• System challenges are universal - Diana shares a fascinating parallel between debugging software and "debugging a cat" 🐱
• Modeling and visualization are powerful tools for thinking together about complex problems

Diana will be speaking at Software Architecture Gathering Berlin next week! Don't miss her workshop and talk on architecture as designing knowledge flow.
