🎙️ Fascinating discussion in the latest episode of Software Architecture: Where Agile meets Architecture! 

Key insights from answering audience questions:
- Architecture is more about people than technology - architects need the same skills as agile coaches.
- The balance between architectural changes and feature progress isn't about choosing one over the other - good architecture enables progress.
- Technology choices come with their own cultures and philosophies that influence architecture.
- Not everyone needs to be involved in architecture decisions, but everyone should understand and value them.
- Documentation is important but just one way to communicate architecture effectively.

💡 Especially interesting: The discussion around "architectural dictatorship" vs. team autonomy when camps are divided on tech choices. Should architects make final calls or facilitate consensus?

🔑 Main takeaway: Successful architecture work requires strong people skills and communication - just like agility does.
