🗺️ Ever wondered how Wardley Maps can revolutionize your software architecture decisions?

In Episode 258 of Software Architecture Radio, I had a fascinating discussion with Simon Wardley himself and a panel of experts about:

• How Wardley Maps differ from traditional architecture diagrams and why they're more than just graphs
• The evolution of components from genesis to commodity and what that means for strategic decisions
• Why architecture diagrams often represent beliefs rather than reality - and why that might not be a bad thing
• The impact of AI and LLMs on software architecture and where human decision-making remains crucial

Key takeaway: Wardley Maps aren't just about technology - they help us understand and discuss competitive landscapes across technological, economic, social, and political dimensions.

🎙️ Listen to the full episode to learn how this powerful tool can help you make better architectural decisions and facilitate crucial conversations about your system's evolution.
