# Folge 239 - Was ist (Einzel-)Coaching und wie nützt es Techies? mit Cosima Laube und Lisa Schäfer What is it and how does it benefit us techies, for example, software architects and other people?

Hello Cosima.

Hello Lisa.

I almost forgot.

You will be at the Software Architecture Gathering in Berlin next week, from 10 a.m. to 10.45 p.m. with Architectural Action – Impactful Mind Skills for Tech Leaders.

And to everyone who is watching live right now, you will receive 15% off all available tickets, with the code SATV-SAG15.

So, now to you.

Cosima, would you like to introduce yourself to the people who don't know you yet?

Yes, I'm Cosima.

I'm almost 42 years old.

I'm still at Lake Constance.

That's always very important to me because I like being in nature.

So, I'm out a lot, a lot on the road, a lot on my bike, a lot with jogging shoes.

And if I don't do that, I usually work on the computer with people and teams.

Sometimes I say, hey, I'm a bridge builder between business and IT, or if you don't take that as a target anymore, between people in the organization and sometimes beyond.

Sometimes I say, for fun, I'm a channel worker, a communication channel worker, so to speak.

How did I get there?

I studied computer science for an incredibly long time.

Then I worked as a developer for over 12 years.

QA lead, tech lead.

And I studied psychology right at the beginning, because I realized, oh, that has something to do with people.

This is in IT work.

I always hoped I could turn off my computer in the evening, after graduation.

Exactly.

And now I'm quite diverse.

I do IT and organizational consulting.

Sometimes I also do interim management, team coaching, organizational development and individual coaching.

Did you start individual coaching right after you graduated from psychology school or only later?

No, it didn't have much to do with the study at all.

Funnily enough, I said through the study, because it was a remote study at a remote university, I would also like to do something professional with real people.

And maybe that's how I got into coaching.

Through these leadership roles that I always took over or that were often assigned to me, we also covered our team lead for a year and a half, so to speak, two and three at the time, I realized I needed skills that I still lacked at the time, which I didn't learn in my studies.

Communication, team leadership, good leadership on the side.

So not, hey, this is going to take a long time because I'm saying this, because I have the power here, so to speak, or somehow a certain position.

And then I was looking for something, more communication, more good questions, things like that, so to speak.

And that's how I got there.

And I did my first coach training in 2012.

First a weekend course, from which nine months became a whole training.

And then I did individual coaching again and again.

Maybe I wouldn't call it that anymore today.

It was more mentoring in a company where I was employed.

When someone said, hey, let's talk under four eyes about a certain topic.

Really individual coaching that I offer for people, whoever finds me, so to speak, or somehow comes to me on a recommendation.

Really classic coaching.

I'm sure I'll add that later.

I've been doing it since about 2020.

Now we've already met you.

And the word coaching has already fallen a lot.

To be honest, I can't imagine much below that.

So what is coaching at all?

You could probably do several streams again.

I often say very briefly, it's a kind of self-selected temporary thinking partnership.

Self-selected because volunteerism plays a lot of a role.

Even if there are often companies that offer coaching, so that someone gets a program, it is still important that the person is there and has topics.

Temporary is also super important to me.

I often say that it's a difference from professional coaches.

Maybe I've seen little advertising clips on YouTube where someone who calls himself a coach brings some funny things to the people, where you should actually take more of it.

Temporary is important in classic, professional coaching.

I'm there temporarily.

My goal is that my counterpart takes something with him for a short time.

If we have a thinking partnership, then coaching is over again.

It's not a permanent companion.

It sounds a little bit like peer programming.

That's also a temporary thinking partnership, right?

Only with a focus on the code and not on what the focus of coaching is.

Exciting, yes.

You could almost see that you are not dependent on each other.

I can only produce good code when we sit together, but still, from time to time, that you also have someone to reflect, so to speak, to ask good questions or move forward together.

Of course, that's just my definition.

I also always find it very exciting to see what, for example, coaching associations say.

There has also been a lot of movement for years.

Should you standardize the profession?

At the moment, anyone who is funny can call themselves a coach.

And then you don't know what's in there.

You'll get to that later, so to speak.

What is individual coaching?

Or what do you stand for under coaching?

And one of the two big associations is the International Coaching Federation, which is a partnership process that encourages reflection.

It is also creative.

It supports people and organizations.

Team coaching, not only in one-on-one conversations, is also a part of it, for example.

And it supports, so to speak, personal and professional potential.

Even if we are often in the profession with it, or I am often in the profession, and today we talk more about what can be useful for our job, we are still whole people.

So that means, if we just say, we only look at the professional things, then we miss something, so to speak.

And very often it is also related to such topics.

And it is also important, it usually leads to more clarity, often also to a change.

In the best case, to the desired change that you imagine yourself or that you work on in coaching.

We also always need active action from the other person, so to speak.

As a coach, I can't do anything for my counterpart.

I can be there, in coaching we can work on something, but then implementing it in life outside, in working life, it always needs energy, so to speak.

So it's always very important, let's say it's not a miracle cure or a cure-all tool or something like that.

Actually, if you apply to a coaching, you definitely report a desire for change.

So I want to change something.

What direction does that have to be now?

It doesn't have to be anything special.

So there are probably different reasons why I could come to you for coaching.

Yes, yes.

So changing is one thing, it can also be.

I also often have people who say, hey, something always happens to me again.

I don't know, I get into conflicts or I notice, hey, I need great harmony.

But now I've taken on a new role where I might have to deal with a lot of stakeholders, where I know we have limited resources, limited time.

Also maybe a certain requirement in the company, where we want to go.

That means I'll have to disappoint people.

How do I do that now?

And I might notice, hey, I want to do it well, but I want to do it the right way, so that you reflect patterns, that you also try out new tools, also have a safe experimental framework, so to speak.

Because it is also, for me now of course I notice, but it is also important to say again, it is always very confidential.

So there are also ethical contexts or ethics context now with the ethics code at the ICF.

So if I'm a member there, then I submit to it, so to speak.

Every other professional coach should also work in such a way that you say it all stays in the room.

Even if, for example, a company is the contractor, it is always super important, that everything that is said in the room stays there.

That's why it's sometimes more possible than if you're talking to a good colleague, for example, or with a good friend or with anyone, so to speak, where it's more informal, so to speak, than in this coaching work relationship.

I can imagine if you just, I mean, I often talk to my husband about things or with good friends.

They know me now, but in their eyes they are also slightly, I'm shy about it so much, but somehow limited.

You as a stranger, you have a completely different point of view from the outside than the people who are close to you now.

So you can give completely different impulses than the people who see me every day anyway and deal with me every day.

Yes, yes.

Yes, that's also something that wants to be practiced as a coach, but also regularly, for example, in supervision.

So I, as a coach, also go to another coach and let my work supervise, sometimes with problems or with topics where I notice, hey, maybe I always come to my limits at regular intervals.

Of course, everything is always anonymous, but that's also something, so to speak, where someone else has a different view from the outside.

And for me as a coach, it's also super important, I'm standing a little bit outside, but I'm still on the side of my coaching partner and can perhaps recognize and offer some things that I have noticed, that I may have heard, or sometimes just reflect what I have heard acoustically at all.

And then sometimes it's like, ah, exciting, I take a break to talk about it, to think about it.

That's often a feedback.

Someone really listens to me.

It's not between the door and the fish, so to speak, as it is also in the work context.

Even if I ask someone, it happens easily, maybe you have something else.

And as you say, you don't know each other, so to speak, or not so deeply.

So when I talk to my partner, that's already a context, or with my team colleagues, so to speak.

But I'm just there for the opposite.

That's my only job.

Exactly, yes.

Yes, cool.

I just had a thought and it flew away, and I'm so sorry.

The classic.

I wanted to ask, did you ever have any negative experiences with coaching?

So maybe you had someone you were supposed to coach, and he was like that.

So you really gave your best, and it was just criticism.

And, oh, that doesn't help at all.

And, oh, what kind of crap is that?

I have to think of such former colleagues all the time, who may have been totally anti-everything.

And no matter what cool tips you had, you always got in the way, because you just didn't get involved.

Yes, yes.

So not yet in coaching, because the person is actually there, so to speak, because they either want to achieve something, or if it's from the company, that has also come very strongly in recent years, that it is often given as a benefit, or actually also as a further development option.

That didn't exist 15 years ago with me, unfortunately.

Which I also consider super valuable, and what people often say.

But sometimes it can happen that someone says, I don't know what to do with it.

Actually, I don't have anything.

I actually don't lack anything.

It's not like therapy, hey, I'm sick, I want support for a problem.

But hey, I now have the space here for me to reflect on something, to move forward, and maybe also to see what I want to do with time.

What is my next career step?

Or is it okay what I'm doing right now?

Yes, it can be.

I've actually had two cases since 2020, where I also said, do we actually want to continue working together here?

Because it doesn't work, so to speak, if we don't drink coffee in time, so to speak.

That's not the assignment.

And every time that really comes true, we can do something else with time, so to speak.

Or in one case, the person also found out, hey, that just didn't fit, so to speak.

There were also other framework conditions.

So it can also be that the coach and the coachee don't fit together, but it's super important to give them space.

So there has to be a good working relationship, a good trust relationship or to be able to develop.

What I found exciting now, what you basically said, which of course now comes through this company story, but that sometimes people come to you who don't even know yet what they might be able to use coaching for.

And that you as a coach can of course work with them together.

You have options.

That's really exciting.

So that you can actually coach many, many steps before the actual coaching.

That's also cool.

Yes, that's often what I've experienced in leadership development programs, for example, that people say, hey, they're preparing for a role or are now in our IT field from a senior developer role, for example, in a team lead and the company supports it.

Then it's always voluntary, there's always coaching.

But still, hey, what can I expect?

It's not advice.

I can't say, hey, manage your team this way and that way.

Then it works for sure.

If I could, I would probably be rich.

Then I could write great books that always work, for example.

But that doesn't work.

But then to look, hey, what are the challenges?

Or to take advantage of this space.

Hey, is there anything where you say, which you may not necessarily want to express in my work context, to then take advantage of the space.

Hey, what can you give to get exercises done or to gain security or to try something out in a small space where you feel safe or to find things out together.

Do you prepare yourself for individual coachings?

So if you now, for example, know that Lisa will come in the afternoon, she will soon be team lead, and she would like to play an architect role, then maybe Isabelle has the next challenge because she needs harmony and now in her role that doesn't have to be anymore.

So do you always prepare yourself especially for the topics that are underlying to be able to coach it better or do basic coaching tools help you, no matter what problem is in front of the door?

That's different, I would say.

You have to look.

Many people say, hey, especially when I book private coaching, I take an hour first, because I may also have something very limited or maybe I want to try it out first.

What can that be?

It's also a financial aspect.

Then it's more like, hey, let's see.

Then I can't prepare myself, so to speak.

Together with questions, with listening, with mirrors.

Sometimes it's also what I perceive in the facial expressions, for example.

So if someone says to me, hey, Cosima, when you talk about jogging or about dogs, then there is a ray against it.

If I had to tell a Roman story, I would think, I found the story at school quite terrible.

And I can perceive the expression easier when I sit across from someone What happens much more often is that you actually go through a certain process.

That was one of the definitions of coaching before.

It's a process.

Then it can also be, hey, we have decided where the coach wants to go.

Or what is the goal?

What does the best future look like at the end of our collaboration?

What is the vision, so to speak?

Maybe even.

And then it can be that we say, let's look at this topic or let's look at that.

And it may well be that I think about how we could approach it.

More like a meta perspective from the outside, let's call it a bird's eye view.

Less the content, because it's always the content of my counterpart.

I can't add anything to that, which sometimes actually happens, where the fine line is to classic coaching or advice.

When, for example, someone says, hey, I've become a leader now.

I should give people feedback.

That may not be common in our culture, in corporate culture.

And if so, it may be classic sandwich feedback.

Start with something good, then say your nonsense or what you want to improve, but maybe also with, wow, to then add something good.

I'm exaggerating a bit.

Then to look, hey, what other options are there?

It may be that I say, hey, if you want, I can give you two or three hints where I found something good.

Or where I also know from experience that it could be useful to try it out, so to speak.

That may be that I actually ...

But it's more like a follow-up.

Exactly, yes.

So if you say follow-up, do I get a summary email or something like that from you as a coach?

Or do I get ...

Let's say we have a coaching and we talk for an hour with each other about a topic, probably my choice, that we came to.

Is the hour then what I get or do I also get a follow-up email with, look, here is by the way this and that, that fits in totally well or something?

It always depends on what we have decided.

If I do a single hour, I always offer it and some people say, hey, I would like that.

Others say, hey, no, that's enough for me.

I either offer two or three more hints that I noticed or came up with for further research, so to speak, to teach, or I always write for myself.

Even if it's confidential, it comes in a shredder.

I can just stay with it super well.

What I often offer is, hey, I can also add a few key points, what did I choose, so to speak, teach.

Whereby a lot of people, if you work together in several sessions, or often they are also very distributed, so to speak, we work together for three months or six months, that then my coaching partner, so to speak, of course designs the process for himself.

Some have a diary, others have, I have already experienced people who somehow have everything on mirror boards, so that you can also work together well online.

There are all kinds of things, but that's more like the process is then opposite and I usually send a follow-up email when we really only meet once, and of course only when it is desired.

So that's always important, because some say, hey, Do you work online or do you also have some on-site?

And if you have some on-site, where is it easier to interpret the reaction of the other person?

Or do you notice a big difference between online and on-site?

Well, before the pandemic, when I was in companies, I worked a lot on-site.

Now I mainly work online, because it's easier for most people, also in terms of time.

And I have to say, I don't notice any difference anymore.

But it's also the case that I work less with people.

There are definitely people who offer coaching, who also work with movement, for example.

We are now more in the field of non-classical business coaching, but maybe if you come up with life topics, so to speak, that you use that more as a method.

I can imagine that there is a difference when you say, hey, we do this by video.

But sometimes people come straight from a meeting and I ask, do you need anything else?

And sometimes they say, yes, come on, let's take a deep breath or something before we really get into the topic.

So even such a simple short arrival exercise, it all works super well online.

But that may also depend on the people, especially with us in IT or many office people, I would say, it's easier to handle the tools well.

We already had individual coaching and team coaching and business coaching and life coaching.

What are the different types of coaching?

I also thought about how to put it simply, because I think we could have a hearty discussion about it.

I would say you can align it according to three streams.

According to the alignment of the coaching, according to the coaching school, so to speak, similar to programming, styles or TDD schools.

Solution-focused is such a buzzword, which is perhaps also known in IT or systemic coaching.

So what kind of training did I do or which training?

And maybe I also work with them predominantly, so to speak.

That would be one where you can distinguish it.

Then, of course, according to the topic field.

So do I come up with business topics or do I come from work, because my employer may even pay for it?

Business coaching, so to speak.

Or do I say, hey, I want to develop further in my professional career.

I don't know where to go.

Career coaching is often a buzzword, so to speak.

Or leadership coaching, that you say, hey, it's primarily about leadership aspects, leadership development.

Or just live coaching.

So there are all kinds of things.

People say resilience coaching, stress coaching.

So you could stick all kinds of labels on it, so to speak.

That's why it's always difficult.

It's also the question of what someone comes with and then stays with it or maybe a different topic develops out of it, so to speak.

What I also find super good to distinguish is this, with which people do I work?

So the number and relationships of the people.

I think of it as a buzzword, individual coaching, one-on-one.

Or do we have group coaching?

So there are coaching instruments, coaching tools, where everyone can work with.

And where you might also share something with each other, so to speak.

There are very often also as offers.

Or team coaching.

We have that more often in IT, I think.

So when people who listen outside, for example, maybe also have Scrum Master or Agile Coaches in the company, there are also team coaching elements in there.

So that the team says, hey, I don't know, maybe we want to work together better.

Then we have this self-chosen, this voluntary.

Sometimes the limit is a bit flowing, that you say, hey, this team is supposed to get better.

That's difficult, so to speak.

So is it still coaching or is it really more of a different assignment?

But we can do that as a team.

Do we want to change something together as a team?

Our communication, our collaboration with stakeholders, maybe.

Things like that.

Exactly.

And then there is, in addition to individual coaching, also more outside of the business, there is relationship and par coaching.

Also as a separate field where you say, hey, you go to a coach together with a topic, for example.

Exciting.

Now where you just said that with the team and Agile Coaches, Scrum Master, isn't that a retro, so retrospective, also a coaching in the end?

Because we as a team determine what is not going on right now, what is going on around the Scrum Master, the person who somehow challenges that.

I had a very, very good Scrum Master.

She was also a guest here on the stream and talked about Scrum Mastering, so to speak.

And she was in the team, but at that moment she was always more on the outside and tried to look at it from the outside.

And tried to get us as a team to see what we can do now or how we can draw conclusions, in which direction we want to move.

And somehow it just feels like the Scrum Master role is also a coach and this retrospective has been our coaching lesson.

Yes, so good point.

I would always say there are such coaching elements, especially in the work context, because it is still voluntary.

Yes, of course, if I'm a retro moderator and someone doesn't want to be there, feel free, please.

So everyone should be there if they want to, or maybe there are good reasons not to participate, so to speak.

But yes, I find it difficult to look at it in the same way as professional coaching, also in the individual setting, where someone says, I want to lead coaching or I want to illuminate the area.

Coaching elements and coaching methods in any case and also coaching attitude, as you say.

Someone is outside, someone may not be part of the team at the moment or leads the process, but does not take part directly and says, hey, I didn't like that so much or I would like to improve there, but really has this role from the outside.

So definitely, yes.

So that I have something tangible, do you have an example for a coaching tool?

A good point, a tangible example for a coaching tool.

Ask good questions, although good is also so appraising again, so ask suitable questions, so to speak.

Knowing when to ask an open question and when to ask a closed question would be something very concrete.

So if I ask the last three minutes of our coaching lesson, and what else do you want to look at today?

It could be, depending on whether you start, we don't even get that packed in, so to speak.

I can maybe ask, what are you taking with you today?

Do you still need something that is round for you?

Do I deliberately ask a closed question or an open question at the beginning or also in between?

Is this the topic we want to talk about today, what we just discussed?

Aha, okay, then maybe we'll open up the frame again to illuminate that.

So that would be a very classic tool to be able to deal with questions, or to be able to deal with them consciously.

That sounds good at first, so I have the feeling that dealing with questions consciously is a tool with which you can actually bring a lot of positive things into the software development architecture.

Because if I ask the stakeholders questions consciously, I get out what they actually want and not that they now want a single-page app with React, but what is actually the goal?

Do you have a cool tip on how to practice asking questions consciously?

Well, one tip is difficult.

Do you have any tips?

Well, there are almost tips that you could implement tomorrow.

First of all, look, what kind of questions do I ask?

That would be the very first thing.

Funnily enough, when I reflected a bit on how my development was, that was one of the first things that really shone on my work life in my first coaching training.

Really look, when do I ask which question?

Very often people say, when I pay attention to it, I notice that I ask a lot of closed questions.

Do you want a single-page app?

Sure, because we want it to go fast.

If the technical expert says so, why not?

Pay attention to the first thing and then look, as you said, if I want to get the right or maybe a good picture of the stakeholders.

The next step would be to look, what do I want to achieve with my questions?

Before I talk to the stakeholders, where do I have blind spots or where do I have gaps that I would like to fill?

What would be good questions that I could ask?

Depending on what I do, especially in the organizational context or team context, I look at a bunch of questions.

I don't have all the questions out of my sleeve, so to speak.

I have already written down a lot of them for different contexts.

I let myself be inspired, so to speak.

It sounds like you master self-reflection as a coach.

But also as a coach, I think you have to reflect a lot on yourself in order to get further.

I always say one tip, but you can say as much as you want.

Do you have any tips for me?

How can I reflect well on myself?

I sometimes find it difficult when I'm in a meeting and ask a question.

Then I try to concentrate on the opposite at the moment and not on the way I asked the question.

Are there any tools or tricks on how to reflect on yourself?

A trick that I often use, also for myself, depending on the situation, for example after every coaching lesson.

Then we are also on the subject of preparation.

I always make a buffer in between.

Because to rush from one appointment to another is neither good for my counterpart nor for me in the end.

And then the reflection also comes too short.

But that's also something we can transfer well into our work life.

If I can do it somehow, when I work with teams, I also make sure that I don't rush all day with one appointment after the other.

Because even if I would sit down for another ten minutes in the evening or a quarter of an hour to let the day's review happen, a lot is already gone, so to speak.

But having another ten minutes, a quarter of an hour after an appointment, to look at how it was now.

Did I achieve what the goal was?

Was it perhaps strange?

Do I still have a strange feeling where I don't have an answer yet?

But somehow that wasn't the best workshop with the stakeholders yet, which could have been.

To write that down and then maybe go back to the basics.

Or just to have it, to be able to look back and realize, hey, whenever I talk to the colleagues from the department XY, then we don't get everything done.

We overdo the time and I come out with a strange feeling.

And when that happens for the third time, then maybe I can take a look at what's going on there.

So planning reflection times when possible, which is sometimes not so easy in large companies, if you get appointments from all sides.

And at the same time developing a reflection practice.

I often say, write it down.

Preferably with pen to paper.

But I also know people who say, hey, I don't want any more paper.

Then write it down with a pen on a tablet.

Or from my point of view, also with a keyboard, so to speak.

Many say, hey, I have a OneNote to reflect.

So what works for you, so to speak.

And what is also lightweight.

So it shouldn't be too big a burden, because A, you usually don't do it.

B, it's extra.

So that's just too much load.

By the way, I think that's a cool tip.

And I will definitely take it with me.

Just after every meeting that I had, just the thoughts that come to me at that moment, or that are still in me at that moment, to ban on paper.

Because I noticed it.

So I make an incredible amount of notes.

Most of you know me here too.

But mostly not about that.

So I usually don't have this meta level in the notes.

So what went on in me.

So small sketchnotes already, but especially in meeting notes, if it's not a sketchnote, then often not.

So then exactly this is missing.

Because sometimes you think, how could I be so stupid at that moment and formulate the question so stupidly.

Or how could I at that moment, what I sometimes have, that I somehow react stupidly, because I want to react directly and don't take the moment again and take a deep breath and say, you have nothing against me right now.

I often feel attacked quickly and then I react stupidly.

And then I always get angry afterwards, because I always think, I should have breathed once, then it wouldn't have been.

I think that if you write down exactly such things, that it's easier for you to work on it.

So I think that's a super cool tip, also for all the people who are watching or hearing this afterwards.

Yes, yes.

It's just a bit of a distance that you take on purpose.

At the beginning it's a bit like, oh, I have to take that now.

So it's really an effort at first.

But then you have it on paper.

Which might also be a second thing, if you say you're already writing a lot.

Really then, I often have text markers and I know some people who use that, say, hey, okay, emotions are maybe green now, something funny is maybe orange, some cool content is maybe blue.

So underlining things a bit helps me when I look back four weeks to see where I want to look in.

Because normally no one wants to look at a stack of paper and dig through it, so to speak, where you think, do I have to do that now?

Cool idea with the text markers.

Of course, I also have enough text markers to do that.

Exactly, what I find very exciting, so now I'm a little excited.

You've been here before, in episode 83.

I'll post the link in the chat so that it doesn't get lost here.

Back then you talked about journaling and I know from a good source that you're still dealing with journaling because you also wrote a book about it, which is on Leanpub.

How do you connect coaching with journaling?

Can you connect that?

Can one help the other, both you as a coach and the coachee?

I think both.

For the coachee, of course, when he or she says, hey, that's useful for me, I'll try it out.

And just these short reflections after work meetings, for example, would already fall under a kind of journaling for me.

It's structured or halfway structured written reflections that I do regularly.

And some say, for example, which topics come up again and again in coaching with me.

Very often, even when you start a business, there are things like, I have too much on my plate, I have too much work, I have a lot of stress, I don't know exactly how I can keep a good distance at remote work or on-site work.

Then it's often like, hey, let's try a little journaling exercise.

For example, write down in the evening what you're proud of or what you're grateful for today.

It's something simple, for some it's too esoteric, what you were proud of today, for example.

Or if a good friend had seen your day, what would he appreciate you for?

So start with such small exercises and some say then, I already have a book, cool, I already use some journaling techniques, that fits in there.

Or some start with it and say, hey, this reflection helps me.

And also for me as a coach, it's super helpful and important, to have my own practice and my own reflection.

And funnily enough, at some point, in the context of journaling, I unpacked a box in the basement to see since when I already had diaries.

And then I remembered, I was in the job for four or five years, I booked a coaching class because I wanted support and there was no support in the job yet.

And then I was told, Ms.

Laube, let's do a diary writing.

Write to the people and ask them what goes through their head.

At that time I had a book, I thought, nice, I'll do it.

Don't write too much otherwise.

And that's how I got there.

Ah, that's useful.

Okay, maybe I reflect regularly.

I had to laugh all the time when I thought about my first diary entry.

I couldn't write yet, but my grandma gave me a marker and I bought a pencil.

That was a picture in my diary.

That was my very first diary entry ever.

But I have a problem.

I don't write a diary since I was four.

I have to have been four or so.

I have a bullet journal, but it also suffers sometimes.

For example, this year, because I had a lot of stress, I had a two-month bullet journal break, which is totally stupid, but it didn't work.

Do you have a cool tip on how to stay up to date with journaling and reflecting?

A cool tip on how to stay up to date?

That comes up a lot.

Usually when we finish coaching processes, the question is, how do I stay up to date with the habits?

Because often there is a tip for you, but sometimes it helps to find a counterpart.

It doesn't have to be a coach, but someone who is on the same journey or someone from your environment to say, I want to start again.

I'm doing this for two weeks and after two weeks I want to tell you that I did it again.

Like an accountability partner.

Funnily enough, it works quite often.

It's the same for me, because I use a lot of practices.

Sometimes I let it slip again and then I know, just like yoga, it would last me a good five minutes in the morning, but I don't do it for two weeks because of stress and then my back hurts.

Just like with journaling.

That would be something like that.

I'm totally touched that it works like that.

It's totally stupid.

You know it's good for you and you don't do it anyway.

Usually you do it for the benefit of things you know and it's worse at the moment.

For example, scrolling Instagram is really not good for anything.

But still, you do it instead of yoga.

Yes, and I think it's super human.

I also notice that when I hear that from you.

Super stupid or something.

I could also say that to myself, but when I hear it from the other person, it's also super human.

We're just so strict sometimes.

Or maybe it's also useful for something.

If I scroll Instagram or Feediverse in the evening, it obviously has an effect.

Maybe I just can't process much more right now.

Would that also be something I could come to coaching with?

You just said people who have a lot around their ears, who are on the to-do list.

If someone like you came up with this topic, you would have to look at what the desired result would be, so to speak.

If someone says, hey, I want it to stop, but doesn't want to do anything about it, so to speak, black and white, or I just want it to stop, what do I do now, tell me what I should do, of course it doesn't work, so to speak, which can sometimes be the case.

There is also such an exclusion criterion, which you either notice relatively early on or in the first few hours.

There are all kinds of different expressions in our brain.

So there are actually people who say, I do ADHS coaching, for example.

I'm not an expert at all, but it may also be that classic coaching methods don't work well at all.

So if you noticed that in our collaboration, it would also be something to say, maybe it doesn't fit for coaching, so to speak, or not for coaching with me, for example.

But in the normal case, or in the case that happens to me more often, it's more like, hey, what do I want instead?

Or maybe I just want less of it.

So quite often it's like, no, maybe just don't let everything be, but, I don't know, open Instagram for 10 minutes and then maybe read another book.

Sometimes it also takes a while to find out what it is, so to speak.

So quite often it happens, I come up with a topic and then also put it in a conversation or in one or two sessions.

There may be other things behind it that are important to people or that you then come up with.

We have a question about YouTube, and you ask, Ruth.

Cosima, should you perhaps consider in advance what you want to achieve with the reflections after the meetings, what you want to improve, or just start at the beginning to identify?

With the reflections at the end of the meeting?

Yes, exactly, so if we let a review happen again about what happened, what goes through my head.

So I would say it depends.

If it helps you to have a structure, so to speak, hey, I'll look at the end of the meeting, what can I improve next time?

Is that exactly the right thing to do?

But if it's too much, and for me it would be too much, for example, I think, in the work context, to look at what I could already improve.

Then first write down what I observed, how did I do?

It's my diary, no one else sees it.

What did I think was cool, what worked well, where do I think it could have gone even better?

So, so to speak, free flow, what's in my brain.

That can sometimes be more helpful than a certain structure.

And others say, oh, then I'm sitting in front of the whiteboard and I don't even know what to write.

Then it would really help, hey, what was good?

What do I want to improve?

Or whatever good guidelines are.

Yes, cool tip.

Exactly, now back to this, I have so much stress, I have so many to-dos and so on.

Has it ever happened to you that someone came to you and said, I want to work on my to-dos more successfully, or something like that?

Too much is going through my head.

And you noticed in coaching, coaching may not be what you need right now, but it's already in the direction of burnout.

Maybe you should think more in the direction of therapy.

So I can imagine that the boundaries, especially for what I feel, what I need, are very narrow or very thin.

Do you know what I mean?

Yes, at least what I understood is whether it can also be that even during a coaching process, so to speak, either I find out as a coach or maybe also together with the coach, we don't get any further.

Or maybe there's more to it.

So I'm thinking of things now, for example, assuming someone comes and says, hey, I have so much on the record, I have so many to-dos, I don't even know where to start.

And then we start, okay, how should it be?

Okay, what could we try out, so to speak?

What could the person change?

And we may find that changing doesn't work.

So maybe it's even that the person says, I'm still much more stressed with the tips, I can't implement them at all.

So that would be a good case.

And I also say every time at the beginning and also depending on whether you don't know each other so well yet, or even if I feel like, hey, that would be important again.

There can also be negative things in the coaching space.

So I'd rather hear, hey, it doesn't work.

I'm not doing well with it.

Then we can adjust.

Or in the worst case, assuming the person doesn't say, by the way, I don't sleep well either.

So that usually doesn't necessarily come in the first hour when you say business coaching on the table.

Hey, I don't sleep well either.

So kind of indicators where I have to say, I know, it's somewhere outside my competence range.

That's also something that really distinguishes a good coaching training or professional coaching.

That you know your limits.

And if I feel like we can't get any further, it can either be, I'm the wrong coach.

Or it's the wrong time.

Or maybe it needs other people.

And then I can point out or I can also say, depending on what kind of work relationship we have.

For some, it's easier to ask, hey, could it be that it's already so stressful that it would be helpful to talk to a psychologist, for example.

Or with the GP first, maybe with the GP.

Or actually just, here's some information.

Burnout test, for example.

There are quick tests, so to speak.

Click through.

See what comes out.

What it does.

And whether it might be helpful to look in that direction.

So, yes.

Exciting.

Yes.

I have another somewhat, I don't know, controversial, critical question about coaching, maybe.

I go to you with a coaching.

Because I notice something about myself that maybe isn't quite so great.

Is it a sign of weakness when you book a coaching?

That depends on how you see it, I would say.

Or how others see it.

So I've actually heard people say, hey, I don't like to tell anyone that I'm going to coaching.

The same is true when I say I'm going to therapy or something.

You don't want to tell anyone, so to speak.

But that's not because of coaching or therapy, but unfortunately because of the environment.

In our society, so to speak.

I would rather say, wow, you're working on yourself.

Or you want to change something.

Or you want to reflect on something.

And of course, it depends on how the environment sees it, so to speak.

Whether I might want to tell it or not.

But I've already noticed coaching.

It seems to have a better reputation now.

I've heard people say, yes, of course.

Maybe I'll tell my colleagues that we have the opportunity in the company.

Maybe that would be something for them too.

And then it depends on whether or not, oh, my colleague told me I needed coaching.

And I don't think it fits 100%, but the analogy is at least in the right direction.

Think about it.

Good teams in football or in another team sport.

The good ones have a coach.

It's not the same as individual coaching.

But someone from the outside.

Someone who can correct something in sports.

Or who can reflect something.

Who can offer something.

A different point of view.

From my point of view, it's not a sign of weakness.

I also have the feeling that it's a sign of strength.

Sometimes I'm missing words.

But if I want to work on myself, that's a really good sign.

And if I still notice that I might not be able to continue on my own.

I want to get help because I really want to work on myself.

That's a really strong step.

That was not a question of me.

I don't think coaching is a sign of weakness.

I find it very exciting and very interesting.

We have another question about YouTube.

AFRL asks, is the willingness to get therapy or to get coached not part of a healthy, agile mindset?

So apart from scrum or similar as a single method?

That's a big question.

Agile mindset, I think we could talk about that.

If I translate agile with flexible.

Not flexible like a fan in the wind, but really flexible.

Maybe I did karate for a while.

I stand properly, but I'm still flexible to react, for example.

Then it's definitely something.

Hey, I might want to develop further.

Can a coach help me?

Or just an outside perspective.

I might have a problem, a problematic event or something.

A pattern where I say it's in my way again and again.

Or it's like a heavy backpack that keeps me back.

Can coaching also be helpful?

And from my point of view, it's definitely agile mindset or agile attitude, so to speak.

Flexible attitude.

But it's a very personal point of view.

I also think that the will to change is very personal.

I can work in an agile team, but I can still be bound by my old patterns or just don't want to change.

I think that's really the case.

You said at the beginning that you have to want to participate, so that something works.

Because you just have to work a lot on yourself.

And you just enter a thought partnership with the person and don't change the person for yourself.

Yes, or sometimes it's not necessarily a change in action.

Sometimes it's just another perspective that I get.

That I might say, yes, maybe I don't have to walk five kilometers every day.

But maybe it's enough if I tie my shoes and walk around the house for ten minutes.

I do it regularly.

And maybe I walk five kilometers sometimes or sometimes ten.

But I do it regularly.

So it can also help that someone from the outside is developing something new with me.

New thoughts, more helpful thoughts, maybe.

I'm just looking at my notes.

Exactly.

Since we already shared the discount code for next week and you have your talk Architecture in Action – Impactful Mind Skills for Tech Leaders, does that have anything to do with coaching?

So there are also elements in it.

We talked about coaching tools and coaching methods earlier.

You can find them in a bit of every one of my talks.

On the one hand, I actually have something from my psychology studies.

So the so-called psychological flexibility.

If you've seen my talks, you might already know the concept, which also has to do with resilience.

So really there are a few tricks.

I always find it important that it also has a certain foundation.

And then also methods and tools.

How can I get ahead for myself as a person who has to do with stakeholders and techies?

I don't have to be an architect, but in that environment.

But how can I get along with teams or groups of people I'm working with right now, with tricky problems?

So there will definitely be things like that in there.

And what I saw on LinkedIn, you started sharing change questions.

These are always small questions where you can think big.

I noticed that.

Does that also have to do with psychological flexibility?

How did you come up with that?

Yes, actually, we already had five questions earlier.

And that it's sometimes good to have a list of inspirations.

A very long time ago, I was still in the team coaching environment.

Deborah Hartmann-Preuss once had powerful questions in English.

So that was also a very, very helpful set of questions.

And at some point I started writing down questions for myself.

Either when I noticed in coaching, hey, that was a good question.

A good question is usually when my counterpart says, oh, I have to think about that first, for example.

Or, hmm, or, ah, yes, interesting, right?

So when there's really a thought process going on, I started writing down something like that.

When I read something good somewhere, I thought, ah, I have to think about that now.

And then at some point I started to link them a bit thematically.

And yes, at some point I thought, why not share?

Also a bit, so Udo Wiegärtner, for example, also asks questions regularly.

So I thought this regularity was very nice.

Also to share these impulses.

Exactly, and yes, it's always important for me now, especially since I'm solo self-employed, to have a bit of visibility.

That's also a reason.

And it's always important to me to deliver something valuable.

So I don't want to share any funny AI-generated texts or anything, just so that I can share something.

But also tidbits with which you can start something, so to speak.

And for those who listen and don't want to be on LinkedIn, because it doesn't necessarily have the best reputation, it's also available on the Fedibörse.

So that's where I have it too.

Cool.

At least I try.

Do you sometimes take your questions and write them down in your journal and then you brain dump everything that comes to mind about the question?

Or do you really just take them as a brain dump without documenting what goes through your head?

It depends.

So often it's a brain dump.

If it's a question where I feel like, hey, that's what I'm doing right now, then it might be that I'll write something down.

And I've actually had times where, for example, the journaling has slipped away from me again.

And I thought, well, now it would be good to start again.

But somehow I couldn't really get myself to do that.

I've also made a bonbon glass before with questions on notes like lucky cookies and then ask a question every day.

Then I can write about it or think about it or say, this question is really nothing today.

And they worry.

So these are all methods that can be helpful.

Funny.

You said earlier, with these meeting reflections, do you regularly have a reflection session in the evening or on the weekend or something like that?

So I reflected for a while in the evening.

Right now, in autumn and winter, I can't do it that well anymore.

I'm just kind of pretty tired.

I often do it in the morning.

So in the morning I have energy with a coffee.

It can also be that I reflect on the last day or something that I still have from the last day.

Rather that I actually reflect directly after work.

But I don't do that in the evening right now.

Cool.

And what I would like to ask again, if I want to do coaching with you now, what do I do now?

I'm motivated now.

Maybe I already have an idea what I want to change, improve, what I want to work on.

What's next?

First, take contact paper.

Otherwise I don't know anything about it.

Exactly.

And what is always super important is that everyone I don't know yet, or who doesn't know me yet, I say, let's meet a little earlier.

So-called chemistry call.

I think that's a very, very good term from the International Coaching Federation.

To see if we can get along well at all.

I wouldn't want to be coached by everyone.

It's certainly the opposite.

It has to fit somehow.

Where you also find out what the concerns are or the question, or what is in your head at all, so to speak, why we want to work together, so to speak.

And also to clarify questions.

How long could that look like?

Where you just do it for an hour first and then look, so to speak, everything that concerns the process, but also the content, that you can get to know each other.

And then you can also find out afterwards, yes, is it something, so to speak, or do you need something like that again?

But most of the time, after 15, 20 minutes, you have an idea.

That can also be a matter of coaching.

It may also be that it turns out, hey, I'd rather like an advice.

But that would also be important to clarify.

And yes, do we want to work together and to what extent, so to speak.

And with the scope, we would also clarify somehow every two weeks, an hour for the next three months.

Or would you rather do it from session to session?

That also always depends on the topic, I would say.

So if someone says, hey, I have a new role.

I know there are challenges coming my way.

Then I would say, it sounds like it would make sense to work together over a period of time.

That would be an offer, so to speak.

But very often, and I can understand that very well, because if I don't know anyone yet, then I don't know either.

Is that really something?

Do the methods suit me?

I also say, let's start with one session, for example.

That's also always an option.

If you then realize, hey, we want to continue working, you can still say, hey, we'll make a process out of it.

So that's all possible.

And it's also always super important, I think you can tell by that, a good coach.

Even if we say, we've been working together for six months.

And after two sessions, you realize, that doesn't suit me at all.

And we can't change it together, so to speak.

Then to say, okay, then we'll leave it.

Or I might realize, it doesn't fit.

Or the hypothetical example before, we realize, you might need someone else, so to speak.

Then, of course, that can always be resolved.

The coaching relationship, that is also very important.

Exactly, we're nearing the end.

And I always like to start with a tip or something cool.

You already gave the tip earlier, that after meetings, you take the time to reflect.

Do you have a tip for me and for all the people out there, how I can become a better architect from tomorrow?

Yes, actually, I would say, pay attention to your questions in your everyday work.

It doesn't have to be with writing down.

Are they open, closed?

How are they?

Do you use them consciously?

Do they have the effect on the other person that you want?

And what's also really exciting is, when you realize, hey, I don't really ask any questions.

I'm just maybe on the go with statements.

Maybe working on listening, so to speak.

So to see, hmm, maybe I want to ask questions.

So that would be the first thing.

Let's see which questions and how.

Very cool.

That also fits in really well.

So we had the episode a few weeks ago, what is the most important skill in IT and communication was very, very important.

And that's just an important tool in communication.

Listening to questions, statements.

So how do I communicate at all?

Very cool.

Yes.

Exactly.

Yes, Kozima.

Thank you very, very, very much for being here today.

I found it super exciting.

I learned a lot and took it with me.

I hope it was similar for you out there.

And you had fun.

I'm glad we had questions.

And exactly, I would say thank you very much for the episode and see you next time at software architecture in the stream.

Bye.

Thank you.
