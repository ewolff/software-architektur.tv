# The Architecture of the Death Star - 20 Years of arc42 and What We Can Learn

## Key Takeaways

- Juan G. Carmona documented the Death Star architecture using the arc42 template.
- The fictional Chief Engineer Galen Erso deliberately hid the Death Star's weakness in the documentation.
- arc42 is suitable for both fictional and real projects for structured architecture documentation.
- Documentation should be "living" and regularly updated.
- The first three sections of arc42 define the context, followed by technical decisions.
- Mermaid is well-suited for creating architecture diagrams in GitHub.

## Core Questions Addressed

- How can arc42 be effectively used for architecture documentation?
- What role do quality requirements play in architectural decisions?
- How do you document architectural decisions and their reasoning?
- How do you handle deployment aspects in architecture documentation?
- How do you integrate security aspects into architecture documentation?
- How can AI support architecture documentation?
