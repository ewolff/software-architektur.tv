ðŸŽ¯ Building Product Teams Beyond Boundaries: Lessons from Banking Transformation

Fascinating insights from Ana Nad and Lejla Vulovic at Raiffeisen Bank International on scaling digital products across multiple markets:

Key takeaways:
â€¢ Transformed traditional lending from 3-4 weeks processing time to a digital solution across 5 markets
â€¢ Achieved 21 deployments per quarter (up from 2 per year!) through aligned autonomous teams
â€¢ Built success through "aligned autonomy" - clear shared goals with freedom in implementation
â€¢ Balanced group-wide standardization with market-specific needs
â€¢ Proved that even highly regulated industries can successfully drive agile transformation

Their approach challenges traditional "process-first thinking" in favor of pragmatic experimentation and system thinking. Critical success factors: strong business alignment, regular feedback loops, and the right people with the right mindset.

Fascinating case study of how to scale digital transformation while maintaining team autonomy and alignment. Worth a read for anyone working on cross-market products!
