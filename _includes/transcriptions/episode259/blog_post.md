# Building Product Teams Across Boundaries: Lessons from Banking Digital Transformation

Digital transformation in traditional banking presents unique challenges, especially when building products across organizational and geographical boundaries. This article shares insights from a successful transformation journey at Raiffeisen Bank International, focusing on two key products: lending for small and medium enterprises (SME) and foreign exchange (FX) services.

## The Challenge

Raiffeisen Bank International, a traditional banking group with over 100 years of heritage, faced significant challenges in their core markets across Central and Eastern Europe:

- Customer loan processing times of 3-4 weeks
- Manual processes across 13 legacy systems
- Growing competition from digital-first competitors like Revolut
- Potential loss of business and revenue

## The Vision

The transformation initiative started with a clear business vision:
- Reduce time-to-money for customers
- Increase revenue and profitability
- Create a unified group solution serving multiple markets
- Improve deployment frequency and time-to-market

## Key Implementation Approaches

### Aligned Autonomy
The teams operated under a model of "aligned autonomy" where:
- Teams shared common goals and vision
- A unified product backlog guided priorities
- Teams retained autonomy in how they implemented solutions
- Local teams could adapt to market-specific requirements while contributing to the group solution

### Regular Alignment Mechanisms
Several practices ensured ongoing alignment:
- Group roadmapping sessions every 3-4 weeks
- Business and technical alignment meetings
- Cross-country retrospectives
- Regular feedback loops to validate direction

### Technology Standardization
The approach to technology included:
- Common technology stack (Java)
- Shared tooling recommendations
- Flexibility for market-specific integrations
- Balance between standardization and local needs

## Evolution and Learning

The transformation journey revealed several important insights:

### Moving Beyond Process-First Thinking
Rather than rigidly applying scaling frameworks, the teams:
- Focused on system thinking
- Cherry-picked useful practices from various methodologies
- Emphasized experimentation and common sense
- Adapted approaches based on context

### Role of Architecture
The architectural approach evolved organically:
- Initially relied on senior engineers
- Later introduced solution architect role
- Maintained connection to enterprise architecture
- Enabled evolution of technical solutions

### People Over Process
Key learnings about team composition:
- Right people in key roles matter more than perfect processes
- Mindset and skills are crucial
- Leadership support enables experimentation
- Change requires willing participants

## Challenges and Adaptations

The journey wasn't without challenges:

### Market Evolution
- Original assumptions needed regular review
- Some markets required more local customization
- Business needs evolved over time
- Strategy adapted to changing circumstances

### Balance of Control
- Tension between group standardization and local needs
- Need to evaluate low-hanging fruit versus strategic goals
- Regular assessment of common platform benefits

## Key Success Factors

Several factors contributed to the success:

1. Clear Business Goals
- Revenue and profit targets
- Measurable customer outcomes
- Operational efficiency metrics

2. Strong Leadership Support
- Freedom to experiment
- Support for necessary changes
- Trust in team decisions

3. Regular Communication
- Frequent alignment sessions
- Open feedback channels
- Cross-market collaboration

4. Flexible Approach
- Adaptable methodology
- Focus on outcomes over process
- Regular strategy reviews

## Conclusion

The transformation journey at Raiffeisen Bank International demonstrates that successful digital transformation in traditional banking is possible when combining clear business goals, appropriate alignment mechanisms, and the right balance of standardization and local autonomy. The experience shows that while frameworks and processes are important, success ultimately depends on having the right people, maintaining open communication, and staying flexible to adapt to changing circumstances.

The key takeaway is that digital transformation in complex organizations requires a balanced approach - one that respects both the need for alignment and the importance of local autonomy, while remaining focused on clear business outcomes rather than rigid processes.
