A vital aspect of modern software engineering is to align
organizational structures with software architectures to enhance
performance. With his extensive experience from Avvo, Spotify, Adobe,
and Microsoft, Kevin will discuss the relation between organization
and architecture with us. We will not just talk about Conway’s Law but
also other aspects like the Homomorphic Force or the Mirroring
Hypothesis.
