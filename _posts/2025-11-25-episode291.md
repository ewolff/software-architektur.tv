In this special live episode from the Software Architecture Gathering,
Jacqui Read joins Eberhard and Ralf for an insightful conversation on the rise of
diagrams-as-code and the role of AI in software documentation. Jacqui
highlights how using textual notations like PlantUML, Mermaid, and
Structurizr transforms diagramming from an artistic task into a
systematic, data-driven process. They discuss the benefits,
limitations, and need for critical understanding when working with
AI-generated diagrams, empowering teams to improve consistency,
collaboration, and automation behind the scenes of architecture
workflows.
