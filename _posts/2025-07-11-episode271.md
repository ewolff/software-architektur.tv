"Fear will keep the local systems in line... fear of this battle
station!" - Grand Moff Tarkin

In this session, we'll examine the most iconic space fortress in film
history through Juan's complete arc42 documentation. This creative
Star Wars project becomes an educational journey through the arc42
template - exploring how fictional architectures can teach us real
lessons about software documentation.

What to expect:

- **A practical arc42 walkthrough:** Exploring how Juan applied the
  arc42 template to document the Death Star's architecture. We'll walk
  through the key chapters and see how each section contributes to
  understanding this complex system.
- **Architectural decisions that made history:** What can we learn
  from the Empire's architectural choices? How does documenting
  fictional systems help us understand real-world architecture
  decisions?
- **20 Years of arc42:** The template celebrates its 20th anniversary
  in 2025. We'll explore why arc42 has remained relevant and how
  creative examples like this help teach architecture documentation.
- **Lessons learned from creative documentation:** What can we learn
  when we apply serious architecture practices to fictional systems?
  How does this approach help both newcomers and experienced
  architects understand documentation principles?
  
Using Juan's arc42 documentation of the Death Star (available on
GitHub in English and Spanish), we'll explore how structured
documentation works in practice - and why good documentation matters
whether you're building software or a space station.

**Target audience:** Software architects, arc42 users, Star Wars fans,
and anyone who wants to learn how to document architectures so that
even after 20 years, someone still understands why certain decisions
were made.

"Remember... the documentation will be with you, always."
