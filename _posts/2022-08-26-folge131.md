Successful software often has a long lifespan - sometimes even
decades. So longevity is an important property of software. But more
often than not, software becomes a mess in the long run with severe
commercial consequences and then it frustrates everyone who touches
it. In this episode, we discuss how to avoid these problems and how
software can be long-lasting with Samir Talwar. He is a developer at
Hasura. Previously, he has been a trainer, teacher, and CTO - and he
is running a hands-on workshop at Socrates conference about longevity.
