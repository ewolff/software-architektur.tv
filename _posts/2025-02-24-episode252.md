Let’s explore the purpose and use of estimates in the management of
software development efforts, and consider possible alternatives.
 
We say we depend on estimates to make important decisions, and yet
we’re often disappointed by the results.
 
Why are we so challenged at using estimates? Are estimates for cost,
time, or effort always needed? Is it possible there are other ways to
approach our work? If we didn’t use estimates, could we be successful
at building software?
 
The default use of an "estimate-driven" approach is pervasive in
software development efforts, and while estimates can be useful for
some things, it is worthwhile to scrutinize our use of estimates for
cost, time, and effort, and to seek better ways to manage software
development projects.
 
There are a number of things to explore and many questions to ask. For
example, do we really need estimates for all the things we are
currently using them? Are we getting a reasonable benefit from them?
Is it possible to manage software development projects without these
estimates, or at least with fewer estimates? Is there a way to prove
that estimates are helping us make good decisions?
