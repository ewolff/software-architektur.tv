Are you already a 10-star expert in Vue.js or Flutter or TypeScript,
or do you still struggle at level 2? And what did your company do for
your advance? And why would you even care about care levels?

While companies are great at ensuring the company's success, the
development of people is often not properly described and
implemented. Together with some experts from different companies, we
started to formalize how to grow experts and knowledge in a culture of
expert work and put the results in a [creative commons licensed
document](https://github.com/kommitment/engineering-excellency).  In
this episode, Johannes Mainusch, Robert Albrecht, and Eberhard Wolff
will talk about skills, skill-levels, personal development paths, and
salaries.
