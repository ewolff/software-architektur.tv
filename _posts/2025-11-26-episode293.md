In this live episode from the Software Architecture Gathering,
Claudine Allen joins Ralf to explore how software architects can
leverage large language models (LLMs) as collaborative design
partners. Drawing from her research, case studies, and experiments,
Claudine discusses a practical framework for engaging with LLMs
throughout the architecture analysis and design process. They delve
into key questions such as what to tell LLMs, how to prompt them
effectively, and how to assess risks—highlighting the enduring
importance of human judgment in architecture while embracing the
transformative potential of AI-powered collaboration.
