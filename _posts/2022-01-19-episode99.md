Many teams work on monolithic applications but want to migrate to a
modern, shiny microservices architecture. Sam Newman is the author of
the most popular book about microservices and has recently published a
new book about the migration from monolith to microservices. We will
talk about how to migrate to microservices - and why microservices
should often only be used as a last resort.
