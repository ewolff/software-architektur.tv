Simon Brown is the author of Software Architecture for Developers; a
developer-friendly guide to software architecture, technical
leadership and the balance with agility. He is also the creator of the
C4 software architecture model and the founder of Structurizr, a
collection of tooling to help software teams visualize, document and
explore their software architecture. So naturally we will talk about
software architecture - and how C4 and Structurizr help!
