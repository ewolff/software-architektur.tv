The SOLID principles are well-established as the foundation of
object-oriented systems. However, after more than 20 years it is time
to see whether the principles still apply and whether other concepts
might be a better alternative. Daniel Terhorst-North is well known for
concepts like behavior-driven development or deliberate discovery. He came
up with the CUPID principles. In this episode, we will discuss SOLID
and CUPID - and why Daniel thinks CUPID makes more sense.
