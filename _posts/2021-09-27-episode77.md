The architecture of a system has to change over time. In this episode,
we will discuss evolutionary architecture and why it is important. We

stand the test of time. Dr Rebecca Parsons co-authored of a book about
evolutionary architecture and has extensive experience with
application development. Before becoming the CTO for Thoughtworks, she
