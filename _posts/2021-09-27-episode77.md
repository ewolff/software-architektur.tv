The architecture of a system has to change over time. In this episode,
we will discuss evolutionary architecture and why it is important. We
will talk about patterns and principles to build architectures that
stand the test of time. Dr Rebecca Parsons co-authored of a book about
evolutionary architecture and has extensive experience with
application development. Before becoming the CTO for Thoughtworks, she
worked as an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida
and as Directorâ€™s Post Doctoral Fellow at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
