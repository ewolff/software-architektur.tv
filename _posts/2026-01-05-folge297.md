The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
and large language models (LLMs) is on the verge of fundamentally
changing software architecture. In this talk, we will take a “look
into the crystal ball” to explore what impact these technologies will
have on traditional architectural decisions, code lifecycle and
human-machine interaction.

We will explore how the use of LLMs could lead to traditional
architectural issues such as choice of programming language becoming
less important, while new challenges arise in the areas of security
and ethical responsibility. We will also discuss the potential
benefits of more automated and optimized development practices enabled
by these technologies.

This talk is aimed at software architects, developers and technology
enthusiasts who want to understand how GenAI and LLMs will shape the
future architecture of our software landscapes. Together we will take
an informed look at the future of software development and discuss how
we as professionals can prepare for it.
