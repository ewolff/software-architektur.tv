Software engineering stands apart from other engineering disciplines -
or does it? Some argue that we are too informal to be deemed
engineers, while others believe "real" engineers follow traditional,
waterfall methods because things are much more stable in their
domains. Some even argue that software development should be seen as
an art or craft. To address the question of whether software engineers
are "real" engineers, Hillel Wayne interviewed professionals who
crossed over from traditional engineering to software engineering. In
this episode, we will delve into the insights gained from these.
