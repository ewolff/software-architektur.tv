Software development is at the core a human activity - and the created
artifacts are among the most complex humankind has ever
produced. Systems thinking helps to merge high technical
sophistication with high human sophistication when developing
software. In this episode, Xin Yao will give us an overview about
systems thinking and her perspective on how it can help complex
software efforts in large sociotechnical environments.
