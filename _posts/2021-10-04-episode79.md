Software architecture is fundamentally about how to split a software
system into multiple parts. In this episode, we discuss this basic
challenge: We talk about modularization with approaches like
microservices and monoliths with Chris Richardson. Chris is a Java
Champion and a Java One rock star. Nowadays, he works on microservices
with his web site microservices.io and his book “Microservices
Patterns”.
