Residuality theory is a revolutionary new theory of software design
that aims to make it easier to design software systems for complex
business environments. Residuality theory models software systems as
interconnected residues – an alternative to component and process
modeling. It uses applied complexity science to make managing
uncertainty a fundamental part of the design process. In this episode,
we will discuss this novel approach with Barry O’Reilly, veteran
architect. Barry will also do a workshop and a talk about this subject
at the Software Architecture Gathering.
