When discussing software architecture, it is important to take into
account the people who are actually working on the code. Adam
Tornhill, author of “Your Code as a Crime Scene”, coined the term
“behavioral code analysis” for reasoning about this intersection of
people and code . In this episode, he will show us hands-on how to
analyze real-world codebases based on this idea with CodeScene, a
software engineering intelligence tool that he helped to create.
