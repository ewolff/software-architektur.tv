We already learnt about nonlinear thinking in [episode
137](/2022/10/07/folge137.html) of Software Architektur im Stream,
when Diana Montalion talked with Eberhard Wolff about this important
topic.

But what about Systems Thinking? Is it the same as non-linear
thinking? Let's find out together with Diana Montalion and Lisa Maria
Sch채fer in this episode.  Diana and Lisa will talk about Diana's new
book "Learning Systems Thinking: Essential Nonlinear Skills &
Practices for Software Professionals".
