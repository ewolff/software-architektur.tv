Software architecture and organizational design are deeply
interconnected. Conway’s Law captures this relationship, while the
Inverse Conway Maneuver uses it to shape architecture through team
structures. Team Topologies adds a practical model for designing
effective team interactions and boundaries. This talk explores how
organizational decisions directly influence architectural outcomes —
and why integrating Team Topologies into your architectural strategy
is probably critical. You’ll learn how purposeful team design can
reduce cognitive load, improve system modularity, and create
architectures that evolve more sustainably.
