In this engaging live fishbowl session from the Software Architecture
Gathering, Vaughn Vernon, Cheryl Hung, Avraham Poupko, Eberhard Wolff,
and Ralf D. Müller tackle one of the most pressing questions in
the field: Is software architecture about human intelligence or
artificial intelligence? As AI tools increasingly design systems,
analyze code, and critique architectural decisions, the panel debates
whether these technologies augment or replace the architect’s
role. They explore the nuanced balance between machine-generated
patterns and human creativity, the ethical and accountability
challenges of AI-driven architecture, and practical ways architects
can thrive in an AI-augmented future. Audience participation ensures a
lively, thought-provoking dialogue on the evolving craft of software
architecture.
