Patrick Kua was CTO and Chief Scientist at N26 in Berlin and is now an
independent coach and mentor to CTOs and VPs Engineering. Patrick has
written several books e.g. about how to talk to tech leads and he
co-authored a book about evolutionary architecture. In this episode we
will therefore discuss how software architecture can embrace change
and support business goals in the long run.
