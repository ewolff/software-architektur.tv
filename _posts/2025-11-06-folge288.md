In IT most of us need to work in teams for various reasons, and if you
think that is not always easy, this is the stream you should join. We
think a lot has been said about team work already, but let us dive
into various aspects together; team topologies, psychological safety,
personality types, body language, remote work and teams and just plain
old communication. Aino Vonge Corry and Lisa Maria Schäfer are
discussing all those topics and are happily looking forward to your
questions. Aino will also have a talk at Software Architecture
Gathering called "What We (Should Have) Learned From Lord of the
Rings".
