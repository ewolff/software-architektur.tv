In this special live episode from the Software Architecture Gathering,
Clare Sudbery joins Eberhard for an open conversation about learning,
empathy, and psychological safety in tech. Building on her talk “Let’s
Stop Making Each Other Feel Stupid”, Clare reflects on how the culture
of expertise in software development can unintentionally discourage
curiosity and collaboration. Together, they explore practical ways to
create environments where questions are welcomed, mistakes become
opportunities for growth, and knowledge sharing thrives behind the
scenes of architecture and development.
