Software architects are faced with uncertainty more often than we like
to admit. How can we deal with it - or can we even make it disappear?
In this episode, we will talk about uncertainty with Kevlin Henney. He
has been a member of the IEEE Software Advisory Board, coauthor of
several books on patterns, editor of 97 Things Every Programmer Should
Know, and co-editor 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know.
