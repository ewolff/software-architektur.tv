I recently spoke at the Agile Meets Architecture conference about
"Architecture and Agility: A Shared Skillset!". The presentation
sparked a lot of interesting questions – covering topics like
architectural guardrails for agility, building the right culture, and
the connection between agility and architecture.  I didn't have time
to answer them all during the conference, so I’m addressing them in
this episode. This episode, like my original talk, is in English.
