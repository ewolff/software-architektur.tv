At the recent Software Architecture Gathering, Eberhard gave a talk on
models, modularization, and Bounded Contexts, while Alistair explored
similar themes in conversations with attendees. In this episode, the
two come together to discuss the key concepts behind these topics,
compare their perspectives, and answer questions from the audience.

## Quote from Parnas

Here is the quote from Parnas' paper that Alistair referred to:

"We propose instead that one begins with a list of difficult design
decisions or design decisions which are likely to change. Each module
is then designed to hide such a decision from the others."
