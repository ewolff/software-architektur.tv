We all have some ideas about what works in software engineering and
what doesn’t. But without real evidence and data that is just an
opinion. Empirical software engineering tries to answer the question
of what can be proven to work in software development. In this
episode, Hillel Wayne and Laurent Bossavit will talk about what we
know about software development, what we don’t know - and the myths
about it i.e. what we think we know but really don’t.
