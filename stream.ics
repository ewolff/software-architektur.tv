DESCRIPTION:“Fear will keep the local systems in line… fear of this bat
	tle station!” - Grand Moff Tarkin\n\nIn this session\, we’ll examine t
	he most iconic space fortress in film history through Juan’s complete ar
	c42 documentation. This creative Star Wars project becomes an educational 
	journey through the arc42 template - exploring how fictional architectures
	 can teach us real lessons about software documentation.\n\nWhat to expect
	:\n\n- A practical arc42 walkthrough: Exploring how Juan applied the arc42
	 template to document the Death Star’s architecture. We’ll walk throug
	h the key chapters and see how each section contributes to understanding t
	his complex system.\n- Architectural decisions that made history: What can
	 we learn from the Empire’s architectural choices? How does documenting 
	fictional systems help us understand real-world architecture decisions?\n-
	 20 Years of arc42: The template celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2025. 
	We’ll explore why arc42 has remained relevant and how creative examples 
	like this help teach architecture documentation.\n- Lessons learned from c
	reative documentation: What can we learn when we apply serious architectur
	e practices to fictional systems? How does this approach help both newcome
	rs and experienced architects understand documentation principles?\n\nUsin
	g Juan’s arc42 documentation of the Death Star (available on GitHub in E
	nglish and Spanish)\, we’ll explore how structured documentation works i
	n practice - and why good documentation matters whether you’re building 
	software or a space station.\n\nTarget audience: Software architects\, arc
	42 users\, Star Wars fans\, and anyone who wants to learn how to document 
	architectures so that even after 20 years\, someone still understands why 
	certain decisions were made.\n\n“Remember… the documentation will be w
	ith you\, always.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/w0fj9kLVjEc https://www.twitch.tv
