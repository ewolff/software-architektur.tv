DESCRIPTION:Let’s explore the purpose and use of estimates in the managem
	ent of software development efforts\, and consider possible alternatives.\
	n\nWe say we depend on estimates to make important decisions\, and yet we
	’re often disappointed by the results.\n\nWhy are we so challenged at us
	ing estimates? Are estimates for cost\, time\, or effort always needed? Is
	 it possible there are other ways to approach our work? If we didn’t use
	 estimates\, could we be successful at building software?\n\nThe default u
	se of an “estimate-driven” approach is pervasive in software developme
	nt efforts\, and while estimates can be useful for some things\, it is wor
	thwhile to scrutinize our use of estimates for cost\, time\, and effort\, 
	and to seek better ways to manage software development projects.\n\nThere 
	are a number of things to explore and many questions to ask. For example\,
	 do we really need estimates for all the things we are currently using the
	m? Are we getting a reasonable benefit from them? Is it possible to manage
	 software development projects without these estimates\, or at least with 
	fewer estimates? Is there a way to prove that estimates are helping us mak
	e good decisions?\n\nIf you want to learn more about Beyond Estimates and 
	see Woody live on stage\, join his talk at the Agile meets Architecture co
	nference early April in Berlin. We have a special discount code for our vi
	ewers for 10% off: AMA_SAIS_10\nhttps://youtu.be/KpsEo7-5kwk https://www.t
