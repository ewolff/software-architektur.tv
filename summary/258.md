# Wardley Maps Meets Software Architecture

## Key Takeaways

- Wardley Maps are a method for visualizing competitive landscapes from technological, economic, social, and political perspectives.
- Maps differ from graphs in that space has meaning - components cannot be moved arbitrarily.
- Wardley Maps have an evolution axis from Genesis (new) to Commodity (standard).
- Architecture diagrams are often just "beliefs" when they are not generated from code.
- Collaborative creation of maps is important for shared understanding.
- AI and LLMs can be useful for prototypes, but critical thinking and human control remain important.

## Core Questions Addressed

- What are Wardley Maps and how do they differ from other diagrams?
- Why should architecture diagrams be generated from code?
- How can Wardley Maps be used in software architecture?
- What role do AI and LLMs play in software development?
- How can maps be used for better communication and decision-making?
