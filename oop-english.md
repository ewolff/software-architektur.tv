# Live from OOP!

["Software Architecture in Stream"](https://software-architektur.tv/)
streams conversations about software architecture - and this year we
are broadcasting live from OOP! For this purpose we - Lisa Moritz and
Eberhard Wolff - have selected some speakers from OOP and talk to them
about aspects of software development and architecture.

The stream is interactive: viewers can ask their questions and post
comments via YouTube and Twitch chat. In this way, you can also engage
in exciting discussions with the OOP speakers remotely. You can watch
the stream at [https://www.youtube.com/user/ewolff](https://www.youtube.com/user/ewolff)
and [https://www.twitch.tv/ebrwolff](https://www.twitch.tv/ebrwolff).


## Thursday 2021-02-11 English Evening

* **18:30-19:00 Grady Booch** is one of the pioneers of software
  architecture. Lately, he has been working on some pretty challenging
  AI systems. We want to talk about AI and software architecture.
* **19:05-19:35 Aino Vonge Corry** We want to talk about
  retrospectives in detail - how to make them great, where are some
  hidden pitfalls and how to take the best benefit out of
  retrospectives.
* **19:40-20:10 Linda Rising** is well-known for Fearless Change, a
  practical guide to facility change. We will talk about how software
  architects can profit from these patterns and deal with the
  emotional, unconscious mind.
