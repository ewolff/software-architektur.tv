# Episode 254 - Communication Patterns with Jacqui Read How are you?

Hi, yeah, it's brilliant to be here.

Thank you very much.

I'm very good.

How are you?

Good, thanks.

So today's topic is going to be a communication pattern.

It's also the title of a book that Jackie wrote.

And actually, she's going to present at HRMeets Architecture about design patterns for software diagramming, which will take place on April 3rd and 4th, I believe, and your talk is on the 3rd.

It is.

Yeah, and we have a special discount code for that, and I've just added it to the chat.

So it's AMASAIS10.

And that's pretty much everything that â€“ oh, one thing.

Originally, Lisa was supposed to do this episode.

Unfortunately, she couldn't make it, so this is why I took over.

So, Jackie, can you say a few words about yourself, what you do?

I certainly can.

## Introduction and Background

So I originally came from a .NET development background, and then I moved into software architecture.

And I got working with O'Reilly after I won one of their international software architecture CATA competitions, and they run those typically once a year.

So if you are a subscriber to O'Reilly, I recommend having a look at those.

And then after that, I proposed my book, Communication Patterns to O'Reilly, wrote that for them when they accepted that, and I've been teaching with them since then as well.

### Current Work

At the moment, I do a lot of speaking at international conferences.

I run workshops there as well.

I'm running a few workshops at conferences this year and also online, and I offer things like private training and consultancies to businesses on topics such as software design and communication and other things like that.

So that's me in a nutshell, really.

Yeah, sounds great.

And you're located in the UK, right?

Yes.

### Location and Weather

I actually had a little bit of good weather this week.

It's been quite nice.

Yeah, it's overcast here, so yeah.

So what are communication patterns?

That's a very good question.

So the information in the book is presented as both patterns and anti-patterns, which is probably something a lot of people recognize from code and also a bit from architecture as well.

So the patterns are things that tend to work a lot in a lot of similar situations, and there's always going to be exceptions to that, but they tend to work.

Then anti-patterns, they're things that look like they're a good solution or kind of might be the default thing that happens when no thought's put in towards being done.

They tend to have more downsides than upsides in the end.

And so communication patterns and anti-patterns are all to do with different types of communication, such as there's visual communication in part one of the book, things like diagrams.

Then there's communicating with people when you're remote from them, which might be your colleagues or might be your customers.

There's written communication in there as well.

And also the way we communicate knowledge, which is partly documentation and partly other types of knowledge.

So it's all split out into the different sections.

Those are patterns and anti-patterns, and I thought there would be a really good way to present it, because people generally understand patterns and anti-patterns if they are a coder, and you can understand what they are even if you are not a coder.

Obviously, this is a stream about software architecture in a way, and also you have a strong background in this regard.

So is this something that is primarily meant to be used for architecture documentation, or is it also useful for other things apart from that?

Oh, it's useful for lots of things, because communication is part of all of our lives and part of our work.

And we constantly communicate, we speak to people, we email, we use instant messages, we create documentation, as you said.

And so the patterns in the book can apply to your whole working life.

So not just actually communicating the architecture of your software.

It applies to all the documentation, not just the architecture, but also how you work on a day-to-day basis with your colleagues and how you communicate with your customers as well.

There's a lot in there about even how to use email well, because everybody is sort of forced into using email, or most people are.

And if we sort of optimize how we use it, I always recommend to people to not to use it for the better option, but if you have to use it, there are some really good ways in there of helping you to do that.

Okay, sounds really interesting.

But I want to dive into that subject a little bit more.

So I'm wondering, with your background in architecture, did that make you write that book?

Or is it something, I mean, is it like you feel that this is in particular useful for architects?

Or is it something, what was the motivation to do that?

Is it something that comes from your architecture background?

I think it's partly the architecture, but just generally working in software development, I kind of realized that it was something a lot of people struggled with.

Because if you think about the, if we just think about diagrams, think about the diagrams that you see, that of course other people have made, not the ones you made, of course.

But diagrams other people have made.

And you just think, I don't even understand what this means.

Or maybe you think, oh, this is great, but the key information I need isn't on here.

Or you think, oh, this would be great if I printed it on an A4 piece of paper, but I can't see it on my screen.

I've got to zoom in and things like that.

And so I just kind of realized that there were a lot of things that people struggled with.

And it's kind of because a lot of people, everyone's kind of encouraged to learn the technical stuff.

You're kind of encouraged to learn the Kubernetes stuff, the cloud stuff.

But what really kind of binds it all together is how you communicate with people and how you kind of communicate with customers, but also how you communicate your design or architecture to your development team.

Because if you can't communicate well, you're not going to get what the design or architecture says.

And you're going to end up with something that probably goes all the way to production or costs a lot to change again before it gets to production.

And you get all these big problems.

So it's great that we all know the technical stuff, but we forget about what a lot of people call soft skills, but they're kind of the hardest skills, aren't they?

Yeah, and I'm afraid I can't resist to tell an anecdote that is also related to the stream.

So last year, we decided to do something at Java Forum Stuttgart, which is a purely technical conference.

And at the booth of Socratory, the company that Lisa worked for, we set up a camera so people could give some statement.

And also, we set up a box so that people could put in a piece of paper.

And we asked people what the most important skill would be in IT.

And it turns out that I think like 50% of the people actually said communication.

So there you go.

And the majority was about social skills like talking to people and these kinds of things.

So I found that pretty interesting.

I didn't make up my mind beforehand like what a likely outcome would be.

But I mean what you said is so very true that communication is so important, and it seems that people really understand that.

So that's the point.

I thought it was quite interesting.

It's one of these experiments that we did where I wasn't sure about the outcome.

And actually, I didn't think about the outcome beforehand.

And it provided some interesting insights.

Okay, so there is a question in the chat from Jude Root.

And he says, I suspect it's a he, I'm afraid that even with own diagrams, when they are not regularly maintained, it is a bit like what did I try to put with this abbreviation box in here five years ago?

Anything you want to say about that?

Any comments?

Yeah.

One of the things I talk about in the book actually is not using an abbreviation unless you put in what it means.

And so one thing that's missing from a lot of diagrams is a key or a legend.

And so if you are using an abbreviation in your diagram to save space, put in the key or the legend what that means.

Because the problem is an abbreviation can mean lots and lots of different things.

And even if you put that in the text next to your diagram in, say, in a web page, if that diagram is then shared without that web page, you then lose that information again.

So, yeah, that's one of the actual patterns I talk about specifically is abbreviations.

That's a really good example.

But with the idea of regular maintenance, a lot of diagrams won't get regularly maintained because you just don't have the time to do that.

And one of the problems, if you use something like, say, UML, it can be useful.

But UML diagrams tend to be very detailed and put a lot of technical information in there.

And so if you end up putting a sequence diagram which has, say, like method calls on it, if you think about it, some people are pushing changes to production multiple times a day.

Those method names could change before you've even finished creating the diagram.

So why bother putting that in?

Put it in in kind of very plain language that anybody can understand rather than going into that detail.

And so if you focus more on the high level detail in the diagrams, those diagrams go out of date far less often, whereas the very nitty gritty stuff goes out of date.

And so if you'll say creating an API, you don't want your documentation for that API to be kind of manually done.

You need to use something like OpenAPI so that when you make those changes, it automatically updates your documentation.

So the things that change regularly find a way to actually automate that.

And the things that change less often, you should be able to then manage.

It's also a good idea to put a last updated date on any particular diagram.

And if that can be automated as well so people don't have to remember to update it, that's also very useful.

But if you see something that's, say, a year old, you know you probably can't trust it.

If it's only from last week, it's probably fairly up to date.

So that's already quite a lot of very useful advice.

In the legend of a diagram, would you also, because Judith would ask not just about abbreviations but also about what the box meant.

So would you also put a legend in there that says these are the boxes that we're using or that's the semantic of this box or that arrow?

Is that also something that you would advise?

## Diagram Documentation

Whatever you're using to communicate, if it's a solid arrow means a synchronous call and a daft arrow means an asynchronous call, you need to tell people what that means because that is a fairly typical thing to do.

But what if someone has swapped it over or they've used a green arrow to mean something, then you can get some, basically you don't want people to misinterpret your diagram.

So give them all the tools to interpret it.

But talking about green arrows, that's another thing to consider and that's colour.

One of the things I talk about is not relying on colour to communicate because you get people who can't see colours the same, you get people with colour blindness and it's not just don't use red and green.

There's, I think, seven different forms of colour blindness, which I quite often and anyone coming to AMA, you will see this in my talk.

It's quite a fun anti-pattern to have a look at.

But we look at how we can, different ways that we can use, not use colour to communicate or use colour plus something else.

And I think problems with colour vision is actually quite common, right?

It's not just a few percent, it's actually quite a percentage.

Worldwide, I think it's 4.5 percent, which doesn't sound very high, but it's over 350 million people.

And it affects men more than women.

I think it's one in 12 men and one in 200 women.

You can't tell.

I've used these slides many times.

And so with the tech industry like it is, with it being more male dominated, you're actually more likely to come across someone who is colour blind in the tech industry than you are in some other industries.

That's something you really do need to consider, because if people misinterpret your diagram just because you use the wrong colours, then you're going to get some very costly mistakes happening.

Yeah, good point.

Deirdre added another remark.

So he said, one solution that I evaluated for myself is the C4 model where I try to get the diagrams generated from code or information that changes.

So C4 is obviously the model that Simon Brown advertises.

## C4 Model Discussion

Yeah, the C4 model can be quite useful.

It's all about structure.

So you're still going to need behavioural diagrams.

You're going to need things like flow charts and other sequence diagrams, things like that to show your behaviour, because structure and behaviour are both very different.

You can't put them in the same diagram without risking confusing people, which is another thing I often talk about, mixing those together.

But, yeah, C4 can be really useful.

### Diagrams as Code

And a course that I created recently, which I now teach, is all about diagrams as code and how we can use them with AI.

And one of the things I teach in there is how to get started with Structuriser, which is the diagrams as code model version of C4 where you can actually just write it all as code.

And so you can keep that with your actual code as well.

So that's particularly useful.

Yeah, and we had actually Simon on the show to talk about that.

So I will add a link to the show notes.

That's obviously also an English episode.

So can you give some more concrete examples of communication patterns, maybe not in the field of diagrams because we talked a lot about that?

Other types of patterns that you can advise or that you find useful?

I'll give you one example that applies to visual, but because it applies to other things as well.

There's one called representational consistency, and that sounds complicated, but it isn't.

It's basically about when you have, say, multiple diagrams or other artefacts, things like documentation, your audience needs to be able to easily kind of see the link between these separate artefacts so that they can understand that whole picture.

So when you look at, say, a high level diagram, like a system landscape or a context diagram, if you're thinking about the C4 model, when you look at the next level down, which is maybe a breakdown of that system, then you need to be able to see that link.

You need to realise that these two diagrams are connected and understand that connection.

So the C4 model has got useful ways of doing that.

So if you're in the context level, it will have a dark blue system.

That's the kind of thing we're focusing on.

And then the next level down, that system where you break it down, that dark blue box becomes a dotted box around the edge.

And so you still might be looking at things outside of that dotted box, like the users.

But whichever one of those diagrams you look at first, you know the link between them.

And so when we're thinking about documentation, say you've got things like a decision record, it might be an architecture decision record or another type of decision record.

You're recording kind of why a decision was needed, what the options were, what the decision was.

And that's really useful.

But it's far more useful if you then link to where that decision record's been applied in your documentation.

So when you're documenting whatever is being designed or done, you then have a link from there to the decision record and preferably a link in the decision record to there.

And if they're not actually hyperlinks, you just reference it.

You say this has been applied here or this is in decision record two, three, four.

And so you're just referencing what you've done.

You can say, oh, the criteria we used to make this decision came from requirement 27 and 28 or from the constraint 14, things like that.

And it just means that when people look at that decision, they can go, oh, OK, that still applies.

That still applies.

That changed.

Does that mean that I can change this decision or it should be changed?

And you're just giving people that information.

Also, it means that people can look at it and go, yes, I agree with that, because they've sort of given me the proof that I need to kind of trust this decision or this design or this this table of data.

And it just gives people that information to be able to understand and trust what what you've created.

But also kind of the ability to change things safely in the future, because every time we know that change happens all the time.

And to make those kind of safe changes, we need to understand why things were done in the past.

So we're kind of linking everything together.

Because you brought up the subject of communication via e-mails, I was wondering whether you have some advice to be better at writing e-mails or is it just writing?

I mean, is there also advice on reading e-mails?

Yeah, there's a bit of information on writing on different types of technical writing and things in the second part of the book, which is all about written communication, verbal and nonverbal communication.

But there's also loads on kind of this communicating with people who aren't in the same room as you, because if you're in the same room, you can just talk to someone.

But I mean, even a lot of people who work in the same room will just message someone who's just over there or email them because they need to copy in someone who isn't there or talk to someone else who isn't there as well.

And so that's kind of why I wrote the whole kind of distributed part of the book, because even if a lot of people are still co-located, they are still communicating with customers who are elsewhere or the odd team member who's elsewhere.

## Email Communication

And one useful thing you can do with e-mails is that you can make sure that you come to the point kind of straight away at the beginning.

So instead of kind of going, oh, because so-and-so is on holiday and because the school holidays are coming up and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we've had to change it, change the date and time of this meeting.

So can everyone let me know what their availability is and blah, blah, blah.

You just say that the new options for this meeting are blah, blah, blah.

Can you get back to me?

This has changed because.

And so people can actually get to that point very quickly and they don't have to read the whole kind of rambling bit.

And if you look at like newspaper articles, they're written in this way.

They give you the most important information first, then the next most important information, then the next most important information.

So you don't actually have to read the whole newspaper article to get the gist of it and get the most important information.

So that's one big tip.

### Subject Headers

Another one is putting in your subject header the important information.

So if it is just an F.Y.I., you can just put F.Y.I. or you can put reply required from Jackie and F.Y.I.

Dave or whoever.

And so people know instantly, oh, I need to look at this or, oh, I don't need to stop what I'm doing to read this right at this moment.

So that's another good technique.

Yeah.

Yeah, I think that's very, very good advice.

And those are really great points.

I was about to ask. doing this, and then we're doing this, and then we're doing this.

And that's creating those connections as well.

## Storytelling in Communication

And storytelling is really interesting because it's how we evolved.

If you think about it, we didn't start writing until a long time after we were communicating with each other.

We were even communicating by stories and talking to each other before we started kind of drawing as well.

And so our kind of verbal storytelling was really important because it's how people passed information on to others.

And then that developed into the visuals as well as the verbal storytelling.

And so story is really important to humans because it's how we evolved.

And that's why when you get kind of disjointed information, it can be a bit of a problem because your brain goes, I need to understand the link between that and I need to understand why that happened before that and what order things have happened in.

So this is a really good question.

I think storytelling is really important and not just when you're, say, doing a presentation to people.

Then it's really important because you're kind of controlling the whole narrative and the timing and the order that you say things.

And we don't tend to think about that when we're creating diagrams and documentation and other forms of knowledge communication.

And so putting things into kind of a narrative really helps.

And with diagrams, you do this as well.

So let's say the C4 diagrams, they're on different levels.

If you were talking to somebody about something, you don't just jump to the bottom level of detail because people need to kind of understand the context of that.

And so you start at the top, then you go down a level, then you go down a level.

And depending on how much understanding people have is how long you have to spend at each level.

So if people have lots of understanding, it's just here's a quick reminder, here's a quick reminder, here's what we really need to talk about.

And if people don't have any understanding at all, you're going to spend a lot more time explaining things and going through stuff.

And so it all really comes back to kind of audience as well.

And all these different patterns, anti-patterns, they're all connected together in that way.

And so that's another thing with the connections and the story through them as well.

So is storytelling means connecting things together?

Is that what you're saying?

Kind of.

It's thinking about the order of things.

If you think about writing a fictional story, you have very basically a beginning, a middle and end, or you have a kind of an exposition at the beginning, you're kind of introducing the characters and then you kind of introduce a bit of tension, the kind of like, oh, what's going on here?

What are the constraints?

What are the needs and things like that?

We've got the scene from the beginning.

Now we kind of get the tension kind of building up.

Then it's kind of like, OK, this is what we're really going to do.

This is what's happening.

And then you kind of get that ending of, and then it's done.

And although that's kind of the fiction thing, you can kind of think about that same thing when you're communicating to people in different ways as well.

So connecting, as you said, from top to bottom and therefore having a story that goes through several diagrams, these kinds of things.

OK, makes a lot of sense.

I'm wondering...

So I'm just wondering, I think we covered most of the book, right?

So we sort of spoke about remote and graphical visual things.

You made another point about communicating knowledge.

Didn't you?

Or is that like the...

Yeah, that's another one of the parts.

So it's...

## Knowledge Communication

There's things like documentation included in there, but it's all about all the different ways that you can communicate your knowledge.

So it's how am I going to present this information?

How am I going to document this?

And, yeah, so there's the four different parts.

You've got the visual part, then you've got what I call multimodal communication, which is a kind of umbrella for the written, verbal and nonverbal.

And then we've got knowledge, which includes all the documentation and the ways that you can share knowledge between each other.

And then the last bit is the...

I think it's that order.

Yeah, knowledge, I think it's part three.

And then the part one, part four is the remote communication as well.

### Decision Records

In the knowledge section, I talk about things like decision records, like I mentioned earlier.

So there's a whole section on...

It gives you the basics of decision records, but also how you can use them more effectively, because I know other people have talked about decision records, but it gives you some tips for how you can use them more effectively as well.

And so there's lots of useful bits like that in there.

Yeah, so there was one thing that just crossed my mind because it seems to be something that I see a lot in my consulting engagements.

So there is a group of people and they develop some piece of software.

And then people notice that, in fact, in fact, when one of them goes on vacation, then whatever that person does, it's not something that anyone else can do.

And of course, they are scared because once one of these people quits or, you know, is on vacation, you do have a problem.

And then usually what those customers say as well, we need to write a lot of documentation because once we have the documentation in place, we have the knowledge in a different format and we can have someone else look at it and that person should be able to do whatever that person who is on vacation was originally meant to do.

And I tend to say, well, you know, that really doesn't work because documentation becomes outdated, it has the wrong details and these kinds of things.

And my advice would be to do something like pair programming, because obviously if everything that is done in the code is by two people, then you can, well, if one of them goes on vacation, it should be easy for the other one to do the same work.

So in a way, this is sort of replacing written communication with direct communication.

And I'm wondering what your take is on this, because it sort of seems like, how shall I put it, it doesn't feel like a very elaborate way of dealing with that problem.

It basically just says, okay, get two people, put them in front of the computer and you should be fine.

So I was wondering whether you have any more elaborate ideas or whether you would disagree and written documentation can actually go up to that level that those people could be replaced.

So what's your take on that?

Yeah, that's a really interesting question.

And I think it's going to be one of those ones that really depends on the situation.

So when I was talking earlier about updating diagrams, I said about the fact that the more high level stuff doesn't tend to go out of date.

## Documentation Balance

And so I think it's really useful to have documentation that does have that high level stuff that doesn't go out of date.

And if you can think about documentation and design it in a way where instead of it all just being, say, in one big page, that you do have the higher level stuff, and then it goes down a level and goes down a level.

I think that makes it a lot easier to update and keep it maintained, because you can say, oh, this stuff, it doesn't change very much.

This, it does change more often.

And I think that can help.

I do really like the idea of pair programming and bigger groups as well.

I think that is a really useful way of sharing that information.

Of course, it gives you a certain level of protection.

If you're only doing pairs, then you've got two people, which you could lose both of them in some way.

They could both want to be on holiday at the same time.

And it's not particularly fair to sort of say, oh, no, you can't go on holiday because they're on holiday.

But the rest of the team is here.

So that's one thing to think about.

But I think there's...

I've recently been reading a book by Donald Norman, which is The Design of Everyday Things.

And I'd recommend it.

It's a really good read.

But he talks about the fact that there's knowledge in the world and there's also knowledge in the mind.

And so the knowledge in the world would be your documentation and the knowledge in the mind would be the stuff that's not in the documentation.

But there's also stuff that is also in the documentation because you don't reference the documentation all the time to do what you need to do, do you?

And so it's getting that kind of balance between what's in the world and what's in the mind, because people will need to get that stuff that's in the world into their mind to be able to then use it efficiently.

And, yeah, finding that really important thing that only one person or two people know that isn't then documented can be a big problem.

But I think, as you said about pair programming, doing more collaborative work where you kind of sit down as a group and talk things through.

So doing the different things like the event storming and, as you mentioned, domain storytelling, doing these collaborative activities and actually talking to other people and sharing information means that you will get less of that problem.

But I think, yes, having really important information, important workflows, when you get a recurring bug or a recurring problem, get those things documented.

But you're going to get, as you say, with having everything in documentation, you're going to get less and less kind of back from having stuff in as you get more and more in there, because you've got the most important stuff in there and then you get the maintenance costs of it.

So you've got to get that balance.

You can't just document everything.

So I took some sort of ideas from what you just said.

So I think one thing that you didn't really say explicitly, but I sort of get the idea is that you definitely want to have some kind of overview as a diagram, because that's also what C4 says and it doesn't make...

I mean, that's something that is not solvable with pair programming.

And it might also come back to, well, creating a diagram takes some effort, but once you reuse them, then it might be more useful.

And another thing that you said is those collaborative approaches, that they are useful.

And that's also a good point, I guess.

If you do these diagrams together, not just one person sitting there, but rather many people are writing the documentation together, then that's also an exercise in itself that provides better information about the system and might be useful.

So maybe expanding the idea of pair programming to sort of pair diagramming or whatever you want to call it.

So I think that's...

Yeah, there's a technique called byte-sized architecture sessions, byte with a Y, the byte-sized architecture sessions.

And that is a very useful collaborative technique when you're thinking, oh, we actually need to document our system a bit and work out what we've got here because we haven't got the documentation.

So that's a good way to do it if people are interested in those sort of techniques.

OK, so how does it work?

So it's all about kind of getting everyone together and it starts off with like some individual time.

So everybody gets time to just, I think it's very short, sort of three to five minutes where, say, you're focusing on a particular part of the system and everybody by themselves, say, creates a diagram, hand-drawn or on the computer, whichever they want to do.

And then you come together and produce that kind of same thing as a group.

And the reason you kind of have that alone time is so that you don't get those people who are kind of the people who talk all the time kind of taking over because there's probably someone who knows something and it may not get in because they're quieter or don't want to speak up.

And so you do that.

And then you kind of create something together and then you come back for another session and you either work on that more or you work on the next bit.

And so you keep going until you're sort of happy with where you are.

And always using the time by yourself and then in the group and in sort of consolidating what everyone has created.

Yes, that's actually very, very smart and a very good point.

So if you could only give one hint to the audience to start getting better with communication, what would your hint be?

I think, like I mentioned before, it's going to be considering your audience and what information they need, because a lot of the other things I talk about come back again to thinking about your audience.

So the artefacts you create, be they diagrams, tables, step-by-step guides, they need to answer your audience's questions in a way that they can easily understand.

Else, why are you actually bothering creating them?

Your audience, they shouldn't need to use much of their kind of precious brainpower.

We all have only a certain amount of brainpower.

If you have to use a lot of it, they're either going to either give up or there might be some kind of miscommunication.

And so if you make things easy to understand, easy to find the information they need, and help them to build an accurate mental model of the system or whatever you want them to understand, that sounds deceptively simple, but it isn't.

And that's why I wrote the whole book about it, because there is so much to consider in there.

But audience is going to be one of the big things that you should be thinking about.

Okay, great.

So there is one question in the chat by Deirdre, and he says or asks, do you have recommendations on how to deal with too much documentation when you end up with a huge confluence that is kind of semi-structured?

I think a lot of people end up in that problem where people are just all adding their own documentation.

So you can, even if you don't have the support further up, you can structure it a bit yourself, not by moving things, but by creating, say, a page that then links to things and structures it.

And if you end up with, say, people coming to your, call it a front door, you can then link, obviously, outside of confluence or whatever you're using as well.

And you can create this kind of main homepage or front door of things.

And once people start realising that that's useful, then you might actually get things restructured.

Another thing to think about is if stuff is out of date, mark it as out of date.

Make it really obvious what is out of date.

Make it obvious what isn't maintained, because not everything should be maintained.

So if we are thinking about a huge amount of pages in here, mark, just make it obvious what people should be reading, because if people get a long way into it and then suddenly realise, oh, wait a minute, this doesn't sound right, this is talking about Windows XP, then they've wasted their time, haven't they?

Or they might not even realise.

So, yeah, make sure that you are marking whether things are in date or not.

Yeah.

So what I find interesting about this is that you pretty much describe sort of a per se for the documentation, like the original Goff pattern per se, where you would just put in a simple interface to make a complex system accessible.

And the other thing is like deprecation, where you basically say, okay, this is deprecated.

So it's interesting how you can sort of use the same patterns for code and for documentation, it seems to me.

Yeah.

Okay.

Thanks a lot for being here.

Thanks a lot for spending the time with us.

I hope we will definitely meet at Erzschaumitz Architecture, I guess.

And I hope we will also meet quite a few people from the audience.

So have a great weekend and see you soon at Erzschaumitz Architecture or other conferences.

That's brilliant.

Thank you very much.

And if anyone wants to find me after this, best place is my website, which is jackyreid.com.

Really easy to find.

Yeah.

Thanks very much.

We will also put the link in the show notes to that page and also obviously to the page for your book.

Okay.

Talk to you soon.
