üéôÔ∏è Fascinating discussion with Barry O'Reilly about Residuality Theory - a groundbreaking scientific approach to software architecture!

Key insights from this episode:
- Why random stress scenarios lead to more resilient architectures than traditional requirements engineering
- How embracing uncertainty and "breaking" your architecture actually makes it stronger
- The surprising parallel between software systems and biological evolution
- Why thinking costs almost nothing but not thinking can be extremely expensive
- A practical example of how this approach helped an e-mobility charging system adapt to unforeseen regulations years later

Barry explains how his experience as chief architect at Microsoft Europe led him to develop this theory, which has now been scientifically validated. The core idea: deliberately stressing your architecture with random scenarios helps it survive unknown future challenges.

Intrigued? Listen to the full episode to learn:
- How to practically apply Residuality Theory
- Why this approach is as transformative as object-oriented programming
- How to measure if your architecture is actually improving
