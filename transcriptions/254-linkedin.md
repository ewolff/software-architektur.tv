ðŸ“š Communication Patterns in Software Architecture - More Than Just Diagrams!

Excited to share insights from my conversation with @Jackie Read about her book "Communication Patterns" and the often overlooked but crucial aspects of communication in tech.

Key takeaways:
- Good communication is harder to master than technical skills but can be learned by everyone
- Visual communication needs clear semantics: Always include legends & consider colorblind users (affects 4.5% globally!)
- High-level documentation stays relevant longer than implementation details
- Structure emails effectively: Put key info first, use clear subject lines
- Consider your audience - it's fundamental to all communication patterns

Whether you're creating architecture diagrams, writing documentation, or sending emails - effective communication patterns can dramatically improve understanding and reduce costly mistakes.

Join us at #AgileMeetsArchitecture on April 3rd where Jackie will dive deeper into design patterns for software diagramming!
