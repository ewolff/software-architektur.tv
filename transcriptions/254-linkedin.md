🎙️ New Episode Alert: Mastering Communication Patterns in Software Architecture

Excited to share highlights from my conversation with @Jacqui Read, author of "Communication Patterns" (O'Reilly), on the latest software architecture podcast!

Key takeaways:
- Why communication is often harder than technical skills
- Smart patterns for creating effective software diagrams
- The importance of audience-first thinking
- Tips for remote and written communication
- How to maintain documentation that stays relevant

One fascinating insight: Adding a proper legend to diagrams seems obvious, yet is surprisingly rare in practice. Small details like this can make a huge difference in technical communication.

Looking forward to Jacqui's talk on "Design Patterns for Software Diagramming" at #AgileMeetsArchitecture on April 3rd!

Interesting fact: With color blindness affecting 1 in 12 men in tech, considering accessibility in diagrams isn't just nice-to-have - it's essential.
