ðŸ“š Communication Patterns in Software Development - More Than Just Technical Skills!

Excited to share insights from my conversation with @Jackie Read about her book "Communication Patterns" and the often overlooked yet crucial aspects of communication in tech:

ðŸŽ¯ Key takeaways:
- Communication patterns apply to visual, written, and verbal communication
- Good diagrams need clear semantics and legends
- Consider color blindness in visual communication (affects 4.5% worldwide!)
- High-level documentation stays relevant longer than implementation details
- Always assume good intentions in written communication

ðŸ’¡ Most important tip: Always consider your audience! What information do they need and how can you present it in the most accessible way?

Did you know that when asked about the most important skill in IT, about 50% of developers actually named communication? It's not just about technical expertise anymore!
