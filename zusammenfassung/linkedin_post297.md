# 🚀 The Future of Software Architecture is Now – And It's Wild

What if the decisions that once defined your software architecture could be changed overnight? 

In this mind-bending episode, Ralf D. Müller challenges everything we thought we knew about software architecture in the age of GenAI and LLMs.

**Key insights:**
🔄 **Spec-driven development** is already happening – code becomes disposable, specs become the source of truth
🧠 **The mental model problem** – why rewriting legacy code in a modern language won't solve your real challenges
📚 **Architecture documentation just got a promotion** – Arc42 + Docs as Code is the playbook LLMs are reading
⚠️ **Knowledge cutoffs and bias** – the hidden forces shaping what your LLM can (and cannot) do
🎯 **Semantic anchors** – the secret to crafting prompts that actually work (spoiler: brevity wins)

From the death of traditional architectural decisions to the rise of temporary, self-healing code – Ralf explores what "good architecture" means when your AI can rebuild entire systems in hours.

The future isn't coming in years. **It's arriving in months.**

Buckle up. 🎧
