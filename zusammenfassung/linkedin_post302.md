# 🏗️ Architecture Meets Organization: Why Conway's Law Still Rules

Software architecture is fundamentally a **people problem**, not just a technical one.

Here's is why:

✨ **Conway's Law isn't a suggestion — it's like gravity.** Your system architecture will inevitably mirror your team's communication structure. Three teams on one module? Conway's law says you'll either split it into three or merge into one team.

🔄 **Inverse Conway Maneuver** flips the script: Instead of designing architecture first, you organize teams around business domains and let architecture emerge naturally. But in reality it is too simplistic.

👥 **Team Topologies** goes further: it defined not just teams that deal with a domain but stream-aligned teams, enabling teams, platform teams, and complicated subsystem teams. Also it allows fo different fracture planes beyond just "domains" — because in real life factors like location, time zones, and technical skills matter.

💡 **The core insight:** Software development is a *socio-technical* activity. Information hiding, interfaces, modular design — they're all solutions to social problems, not just technical ones.

🎯 The uncomfortable truth: Architects without formal authority can have MORE influence than those with it. Convincing people beats commanding them.
