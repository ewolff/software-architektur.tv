# 🏗️ Architecture Meets Organization: Why Conway's Law Still Rules

Just watched an eye-opening discussion about why software architecture is fundamentally a **people problem**, not just a technical one.

Here's what blew my mind:

✨ **Conway's Law isn't a suggestion—it's gravity.** Your system architecture will inevitably mirror your team's communication structure. Three teams on one module? Gravity says you'll either split it into three or merge into one team.

🔄 **Inverse Conway Maneuver** flips the script: Instead of designing architecture first, you organize teams around business domains and let architecture emerge naturally. But here's the catch—it only works if your legacy system allows it.

👥 **Team Topologies** goes further: stream-aligned teams, enabling teams, platform teams, and complicated subsystem teams. Different fracture planes beyond just "domains"—because real life factors like location, time zones, and technical skills matter.

💡 **The core insight:** Software development is a *socio-technical* activity. Information hiding, interfaces, modular design—they're all solutions to social problems, not just technical ones.

🎯 The uncomfortable truth: Architects without formal authority often have MORE influence than those with it. Convincing people beats commanding them.

Curious about how to actually implement this in your enterprise? Check out **Fearless Change** patterns and **Event Storming** as practical tactics.

**What's your biggest challenge with team structure and architecture alignment?** 🤔
