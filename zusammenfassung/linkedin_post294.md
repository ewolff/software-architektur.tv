# Let's Stop Making Each Other Feel Stupid – A Game-Changer for Tech Teams

I had an incredible conversation with Clare Sudbery at the Software Architecture Gathering in Berlin, and I had to share this.

**The core issue:** In tech, we're obsessed with *what people know*. This creates a toxic cycle where people hide their ignorance, pretend to understand jargon they don't, and feel like frauds. The result? Imposter syndrome, tribal gatekeeping, and talented engineers leaving the industry.

**The breakthrough insight:** What if we reframed this entirely?

Clare's "Stupidity Manifesto" flips the script:
✓ Value curiosity over knowledge
✓ Encourage questions (confident, not apologetic)
✓ Celebrate learning as a shared journey
✓ Remember: you're one of today's "lucky 10,000" learning something new

**The magic happens when senior engineers lead by example** – asking questions without apology, getting excited about what they *don't* know, and inviting juniors to teach them too.

This isn't just about being nice. It's about:
- Breaking toxic team dynamics
- Unlocking real collaboration
- Making knowledge actually transferable
- Keeping diverse talent from burning out

Whether you're an architect, tech lead, or individual contributor, this hits home. The technical problems we struggle with pale in comparison to the *human* problems we create for each other.

Ready to build teams where people feel safe, curious, and valued?
