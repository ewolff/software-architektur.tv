# 🎯 Do We Really Need to Talk About Teamwork? Here's What You're Missing

In this episode, Aino Vonge Corry and Lisa Maria Schäfer tackle one of software development's most overlooked challenges: **why great teamwork remains so elusive** — even when we keep talking about it.

Here's what they unpack:

✅ **Self-reflection is a skill, not a default setting** — and most of us were never trained to do it. But there are ways to build psychological safety around it.

✅ **Not everyone will love retrospectives** — and that's okay. But understanding *why* someone resists them can change everything.

✅ **The uncomfortable truth about "teams":** We're obsessed with forcing collaboration, but not everyone thrives in traditional team structures. Some people work best independently — and that deserves respect.

✅ **Quality beats quantity in ceremonies** — A soulless daily standup kills productivity more than silence ever could.

✅ **Not every group is a team.** A real team needs shared goals, mutual support, and the ability to help each other. Calling something a team doesn't make it one.

The key takeaway? Stop romanticizing teamwork and start building the conditions where it actually matters.

**Listen now to discover how to make your team *want* to improve together.** 🎧
