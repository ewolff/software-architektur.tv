# 🎨 Diagrams as Code + AI: The Future of Architecture Documentation?

Just dropped a fascinating conversation with @JacquiRead on our podcast about transforming how we document software architecture.

Here's what we explored:

**The Core Idea:** Stop drawing diagrams. Start *coding* them. 🔤
Tools like PlantUML, Mermaid, and Structurizr let you define diagrams as text—which means they're versionable, diffable, and maintainable alongside your codebase.

**Where AI Comes In:**
✅ Converting between diagram languages
✅ Helping you refactor existing diagrams  
✅ Generating structure from specifications
⚠️ BUT... AI hallucinations are real. You need solid fundamentals to catch errors.

**The Big Insight:** 
Not all tools fit all jobs. C4 diagrams? Structurizr wins. Sequence diagrams in markdown? Mermaid is better. And please, add legends to your diagrams (Jacqui even has a t-shirt about this 😄).

**Bonus:** We touched on Spec-Driven Development—where you write specs with AI, validate with diagrams, and have the AI generate code. It's young, it's waterfall-ish, and it needs diagrams as code.

The truth: Humans still drive this. AI is a tool, not a replacement for architectural thinking.
