🤖 **Collaborative Software Architecting with LLMs: A Game Changer?**

Ever wondered how AI can actually *help* (not replace) your software architecture process?

In a fascinating conversation at the iSAQB Software Architecture Gathering, Ralf D. Müller spoke with **Claudine Allen** about her innovative approach to using Large Language Models in architectural design—and the results are eye-opening.

Key takeaways:

✅ **Don't ask AI to solve your entire architecture at once** — instead, use it as an intelligent assistant for stepwise, incremental design
✅ **LLMs excel at research & brainstorming** — especially for well-documented methodologies like arc42, quality scenarios, and domain knowledge
✅ **Even in niche domains** (like translating audio to sign language!), AI helps uncover hidden requirements and technical solutions you didn't know existed

But here's the real story: Claudine has been teaching students in Jamaica to use LLMs *responsibly* for architecture work—turning a potential threat into a learning opportunity. Her approach? **Transparency, accountability, and learning through collaborative exchange.**

The result? Lower learning curves, better documentation, and architects better prepared for industry.
