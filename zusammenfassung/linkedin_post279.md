üéôÔ∏è Fascinating discussion with Barry O'Reilly about Residuality Theory - a novel approach to software architecture!

Key insights from this episode:
- Why random stress scenarios lead to more resilient architectures than traditional requirements engineering.
- How embracing uncertainty and "breaking" your architecture actually makes it stronger.
- The surprising parallel between software systems and biological evolution.
- A practical example of how this approach helped an e-mobility charging system adapt to unforeseen regulations years later.

Barry explains how his experience as chief architect at Microsoft Europe led him to develop this theory, which has been scientifically validated. The core idea: deliberately stressing your architecture with random scenarios helps it survive unknown future challenges.
