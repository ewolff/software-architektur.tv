# 🏗️ Models, Modularization & Hidden Decisions: A Deep Dive with Alistair Cockburn

Just wrapped an incredible conversation with **Alistair Cockburn** (the inventor of hexagonal architecture!) diving deep into some timeless software architecture principles that most teams still get wrong.

## Here's what we explored:

🔍 **Decision Hiding vs. Information Hiding** - It's not about data. It's about hiding the *decisions* that are likely to change. Parnas figured this out in 1972, and it's still the foundation for good design.

🎯 **Modularization is a Verb** - It's something you *do*, not something you have. The question isn't just "how do modules work?" but "how do we come up with good modules in the first place?"

🧩 **Bounded Contexts Meet CRC Cards** - We connected event storming, domain-driven design, and the old-school CRC cards approach. Turns out they're all solving the same problem from different angles.

💼 **"It's Not My Job"** - The most human way to think about encapsulation. When objects (or team members) understand what they're responsible for—and what they're NOT—you get better design.

⚠️ **The YAGNI vs. Generalization Tension** - How do you know what will change? And when does building flexibility become over-engineering complexity?

This is essential listening for architects, senior engineers, and anyone wrestling with system design.
