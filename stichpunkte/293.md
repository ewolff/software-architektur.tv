# Episode 293 - Collaborative Software Architecting with LLMs with Claudine Allen

## Key Takeaways

- LLMs should be used incrementally for specific architectural tasks rather than attempting to solve entire architecture problems at once.
- AI excels at accelerating research, clarifying requirements, defining quality scenarios, and providing documentation templates for well-documented domains.
- The arc42 methodology significantly reduces the learning curve for students working on smaller business projects compared to SEI-based approaches.
- Students must maintain transparency about LLM usage and responsibility for final deliverables to ensure genuine learning occurs.
- Mermaid diagram code combined with AI tools enables higher-level abstraction in architecture discussions without token waste from image processing.
- Hallucinations are primarily contextual rather than factual, affecting domain-specific recommendations more than documented methodologies like arc42.

## Core Questions Addressed

- How can Large Language Models effectively support the software architecture process without replacing architect expertise?
- What is glossing and why is it critical for sign language translation architecture?
- Why is the arc42 more suitable for educational settings and smaller business projects than traditional SEI methodologies?
- How should educators integrate AI tools into curricula while ensuring genuine student learning and preventing academic dishonesty?
- Can LLMs generate accurate Mermaid diagram code for component and sequence diagrams?
- What approaches mitigate hallucination risks when using LLMs for domain-specific architectural recommendations?

## Important Questions from the Episode

1. How can LLMs be incorporated into the software architecture methodology without compromising the architect's role?
2. Why is glossing necessary in the translation pipeline from spoken language to sign language?
3. What makes arc42 more accessible than SEI-based approaches for university students in Jamaica?
4. How can educators verify student learning when AI tools are available for documentation and design tasks?
5. What are the differences between using LLM-generated images versus Mermaid code for architectural diagrams?
6. How can students identify and handle hallucinations in LLM responses during architectural work?

## Glossary of Key Terms

- **Glossing**: An intermediate translation step between natural language text and sign language that captures semantic and gestural nuances rather than word-for-word equivalents.
- **arc42**: An open-source template for documenting software architecture using four main views (context, building block, runtime, deployment) plus cross-cutting concerns.
- **Quality Scenarios**: Measurable quality requirements expressed with specific stimulus, response, and response measure to ensure architectural decisions align with non-functional goals.
- **Mermaid**: A JavaScript-based diagram generation tool that renders diagrams from code syntax, enabling LLMs to provide architectural specifications without image generation.
- **CPSA (Certified Professional for Software Architecture)**: An ISAQB certification program providing standardized competency training for software architects across different experience levels.
- **Hallucination**: LLM-generated false or contextually inappropriate information presented with confidence, particularly problematic in domain-specific architectural recommendations beyond well-documented methodologies.
