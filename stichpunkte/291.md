## Key Takeaways

- Diagrams-as-code using tools like PlantUML, Mermaid, and Structurizr provides maintainable, version-controllable alternatives to traditional drawing tools with automatic layout capabilities.
- AI support for diagram generation is optional and most useful for specific tasks like format conversion or error correction rather than full diagram creation from high-level prompts.
- Structurizr's model-based approach automatically updates all diagram views when changes occur, providing a significant advantage over individual PlantUML or Mermaid diagrams.
- Skilled human expertise is essential when working with AI-generated diagrams, as LLMs frequently hallucinate syntax and create invalid code requiring careful validation.
- C4 diagrams address architectural structure, while sequence and activity diagrams communicate system behavior, both being necessary for complete architectural documentation.
- Legends and proper labeling in diagrams are critical for accessibility and understanding, but not all tools support them adequately.

## Core Questions Addressed

- How can AI effectively assist in creating and converting diagrams between different code-based formats?
- What are the key differences between PlantUML, Mermaid, and Structurizr, and when should each tool be selected?
- How does the C4 model structure system architecture across different abstraction levels?
- What role do diagrams play within spec-driven development practices?
- How can architectural diagrams be kept synchronized with actual implementation code?
- What skills do developers need to effectively use AI with diagram-as-code tools?

## Glossary of Important Terms

- **Diagrams as Code**: Creating and managing visual diagrams using text-based domain-specific languages (DSLs) that can be versioned, diffed, and stored alongside code repositories.

- **PlantUML**: A popular diagram-as-code tool built on Java that supports multiple UML diagram types but requires additional rendering steps for web integration.

- **Mermaid**: A JavaScript-based diagram-as-code framework designed for easy web integration and rendering in modern platforms like GitHub, supporting various diagram types.

- **Structurizr**: A C4 diagram tool featuring an underlying model architecture that automatically propagates changes across multiple diagram views and supports custom styling similar to CSS.

- **C4 Model**: A hierarchical approach to architectural documentation consisting of Context, Container, Component, and Code levels that progressively zoom into system architecture details.

- **Spec-Driven Development**: An emerging methodology where specifications written in Markdown guide AI-generated code implementation, emphasizing documentation-first approach with human review of generated artifacts.

- **LLM Hallucination**: The phenomenon where large language models generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or fabricated information, including invalid syntax or nonexistent features in domain-specific languages.

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Documented decisions explaining the "why" behind architectural choices, essential for maintaining understanding and reproducibility beyond the "how" and "what".
