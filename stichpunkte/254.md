# Episode 254 - Communication Patterns with Jacqui Read

## Key Takeaways
- Communication is one of the most critical skills in software development, often considered more important than technical skills
- Communication patterns can be divided into visual, written, knowledge-sharing, and remote communication
- Good diagrams should include legends/keys, avoid relying solely on color, and maintain consistent representation
- Documentation should focus on different levels of detail, with high-level information being more stable and detailed information being automated where possible
- The C4 model is useful for creating understandable system documentation at different levels of abstraction
- Email communication should prioritize important information first and use clear subject lines
- Collaborative approaches like pair programming and byte-sized architecture sessions help share knowledge effectively

## Core Questions Addressed
- What are communication patterns and why are they important?
