## Key Takeaways

- The C4 model provides a hierarchical approach to architecture diagrams at four levels of abstraction (Context, Containers, Components, Code) that brings structure to informal whiteboard sketching without UML's complexity.
- Architecture remains essential in Agile teams despite early dismissals, particularly as systems grow more complex with cloud services, microservices, and external dependencies that require technical leadership.
- Software architects should ideally participate in coding to maintain awareness of implementation realities, architectural constraints compliance, and to validate design decisions through hands-on feedback.
- Structurizr tools enable single-model-based diagram generation from text-based domain-specific language (DSL), ensuring consistency across multiple architecture views and enabling version control integration.
- System context diagrams serve as critical anchoring mechanisms that identify all external system dependencies, enabling impact analysis and risk assessment for organizational changes.
- Top two C4 levels (Context and Containers) are mandatory and useful for all teams, while lower levels (Components and Code) are optional and should be auto-generated from code rather than manually created.

## Core Questions Addressed

- Why should software developers care about architecture if they aren't formally trained as architects?
- Do Agile teams actually need software architects, or is architecture documentation an outdated practice from the waterfall era?
- Should software architects write code, or should they focus exclusively on communication, documentation, and cross-team collaboration?
- What are the core differences between the C4 model and traditional UML, and why does C4 succeed where UML failed in widespread adoption?
- How do the four levels of C4 diagrams (Context, Containers, Components, Code) differ in their purposes, audiences, and practical applications?
- How can architecture documentation remain consistent with actual code implementations when systems continuously evolve?

## Glossary of Key Terms

- **C4 Model**: A hierarchical diagramming technique consisting of four levels of abstraction (Context, Containers, Components, Code) designed to communicate software architecture with varying levels of detail to different audiences.
- **Container** (in C4 context): An independently runnable or deployable unit such as a web application, server-side application, database, microservice, or batch script that forms part of the overall system architecture.
- **Structurizr**: A collection of open-source and commercial tools that generate multiple consistent architecture diagrams from a single model definition stored in JSON or domain-specific language (DSL) format.
- **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)**: A document capturing a significant architectural choice, its rationale, consequences, and alternatives, serving as historical documentation of how and why architectural decisions were made.
- **System Context Diagram**: The top-level C4 diagram showing the software system as a single box with its external users, actors, and dependent systems, establishing the scope and environment of the system.
- **Structurizr Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**: A text-based syntax that allows developers to define software architecture models in a succinct, code-like format that can be parsed into JSON models and exported to various diagram formats.
