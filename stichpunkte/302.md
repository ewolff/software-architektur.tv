# Episode 302 - Architecture and Organization Inverse Conway and Team Topologies

## Key Takeaways

- Software architecture fundamentally requires controlling information flow through modules and information hiding principles, which is inherently a social problem involving developer communication and organization.
- Conway's Law states that system architecture naturally mirrors organizational communication structures, making it impossible to have three teams work on one module without either merging them or splitting the module.
- Inverse Conway applies organizational structure to architecture design by assigning domains to teams, but architects lack full control over organizational decisions influenced by priorities, deadlines, and resource constraints.
- Team Topologies defines multiple team interaction patterns (stream-aligned, enabling, platform, and complicated subsystem teams) that provide more flexible fracture planes than domain-only alignment.
- Architects influence outcomes through conversation and persuasion rather than formal authority, requiring collaborative techniques like event storming and post-it exercises for inclusive decision-making.
- Software development success depends on recognizing it as a socio-technical activity where people coordination is typically more critical than technical architecture decisions.

## Core Questions Addressed

- How does information hiding at the module level apply across different architectural scales from classes to microservices?
- Why can't three teams effectively work on a single module according to Conway's Law and information hiding principles?
- What distinguishes Inverse Conway from traditional top-down architecture approaches and why doesn't it fully work in practice?
- How do Team Topologies patterns accommodate real-world organizational constraints like geographic distribution and technical specialization?
- What concrete tactics can architects use to shape team structures and organizational decisions without formal authority?
- How should organizations measure success and identify warning signals when implementing Inverse Conway experiments?

## Glossary of Key Terms

- **Information Hiding**: An architectural principle where implementation details are concealed behind interfaces, reducing cognitive load and enabling independent module modifications without affecting dependent components.
- **Conway's Law**: The principle that software architecture naturally reflects the communication structure and organizational hierarchy of the development organization.
- **Inverse Conway Maneuver**: A deliberate organizational strategy where team structure and domain assignments are designed first to intentionally shape the resulting software architecture.
- **Stream-Aligned Teams**: Cross-functional teams organized around specific business domains or value streams responsible for delivering features end-to-end from development to production.
- **Enabling Teams**: Specialized support teams that provide technical expertise, guidance, and temporary collaboration assistance to stream-aligned teams on specific architectural or technical challenges.
- **Platform Teams**: Infrastructure-focused teams providing shared services, tools, and platforms (like Kubernetes or CI/CD systems) that other development teams depend upon to deliver their work.
