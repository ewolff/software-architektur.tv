# Episode 296 - Models and Modularization with Alistair Cockburn

## Key Takeaways

- Information hiding is fundamentally about hiding design decisions, not just data, allowing changes to be localized and reducing the trajectory of change across modules.
- Parnas's 1972 paper on decomposing systems into modules is more important than his information hiding paper because it addresses how to actually create modules through decision-encapsulation.
- Modularization should balance simplicity with anticipating likely changes, avoiding both over-generalization (too many hinge points) and inflexibility (tightly coupled systems).
- Separating technical concerns (I/O, persistence) from business logic using patterns like hexagonal architecture creates a foundation for better domain-focused modularization.
- CRC Cards (Class-Responsibility-Collaboration) remain a powerful tool for collaborative design, using intuitive phrases like "it's not my job" and "has no need to know" to validate encapsulation decisions.
- Event storming and bounded contexts provide a vocabulary-building approach to identifying natural module boundaries through pivotal events and parallel activities in business processes.

## Core Questions Addressed

- How can design decisions be hidden to reduce the complexity of system changes and limit the trajectory of change across modules?
- Why do many systems fail to properly encapsulate the database decision, and what are the consequences of exposing persistence technology throughout the codebase?
- Should modularization be based on workflow sequencing, or should it emerge from identifying stable design decisions and likely areas of change?
- How can teams use CRC Cards and responsibility statements to create shared understanding and validate whether a design properly distributes concerns?
- What is the relationship between building up vocabulary through bounded contexts and event storming, and creating effective module boundaries?
- How can organizations balance the principle of "you ain't gonna need it" (YAGNI) with legitimate anticipation of future changes to avoid both over-engineering and brittleness?

## Glossary of Key Terms

- **Information Hiding**: Encapsulating design decisions behind stable interfaces so that implementation choices can change without affecting clients that depend on those interfaces.

- **Trajectory of Change**: The measurement of how many modules or components must be modified to implement a single change, where fewer modules represent better modularization.

- **Decision Hiding**: The practice of concealing architectural or implementation choices (such as caching vs. computing values) from clients through consistent interfaces, enabling local design flexibility.

- **Bounded Context**: A clearly defined boundary within a domain model where a specific vocabulary and set of rules apply, helping identify natural module and system boundaries in complex business systems.

- **CRC Cards**: A lightweight design technique using index cards to represent Classes, define their Responsibilities, and map their Collaborations, enabling collaborative scenario-based design validation.

- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**: An architectural pattern that separates core business logic from technical concerns like databases and external systems through well-defined ports, enabling independent testing and technology substitution.
