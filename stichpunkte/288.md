# Episode 288 - Team Work – Do we still need to talk about it? with Aino Vonge Corry and Lisa Maria Schäfer

## Wichtige Keytakeaways

- Self-reflection is a critical skill that most people are not trained in during their education, making it difficult to introduce in team settings like retrospectives.
- Creating psychological safety for reflection requires starting small with individual reflection before sharing, removing fear of judgment and consequences.
- Not all groups calling themselves "teams" function as actual teams; true teams require shared goals, mutual interest, and the ability to help each other.
- Retrospectives should focus on three core elements: sharing, appreciation, and learning to maintain their value and engagement.
- Skeptical team members often resist retrospectives due to past negative experiences or role identity; involving them in improving retrospective structure can turn resistance into collaboration.
- Forcing people into ceremonies they find exhausting diminishes effectiveness; quality of meetings matters more than frequency, and not everyone thrives in team-based structures.
