## Episode Title
Episode 279 - Residuality Theory with Barry O'Reilly

## Key Takeaways
- Residuality Theory states that random simulation of stress produces stronger, more resilient architectures than traditional requirement-based approaches
- The theory is based on complexity science and biological systems research by Stuart Kaufman
- Architecture needs to reach a point of "criticality" where it can survive unknown forms of stress
- Random stressors help identify system "attractor states" - limited possible states the system can arrive in
- Thinking through stressors is inexpensive compared to fixing architectural issues later
- The approach is scientifically verifiable and measurable

## Core Questions Addressed
- How do we design architectures that can survive unknown future requirements?
- Why does random stress simulation work better than detailed requirements?
- How do you identify and work with stressors?
- What is the scientific foundation behind Residuality Theory?
- How do you know if you're applying the theory correctly?

## Glossary of Key Terms
- Residuality Theory: Approach to software architecture using random stress simulation to create resilient systems
- Stressor: Any form of stress outside current model/understanding of business system
- Criticality: Point where system can adapt to change but isn't too complex to maintain
- Attractor States: Limited number of states a complex system can arrive in
- Edge of Chaos: Point where system can survive things it wasn't designed for
- Random Boolean Networks: Mathematical model showing how system components affect possible states
- Stressor Analysis: Tool/process for recording and analyzing system stressors
- YAGNY (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Principle often misused to stop architectural thinking
