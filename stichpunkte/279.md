## Key Takeaways

* Residuality Theory states that randomly simulating stress produces a more resilient architecture.
* The theory is based on scientific findings from complexity research, particularly the work of Stuart Kauffman.
* Architectures are tested and improved through stressors (factors causing strain).
* The goal is an architecture that can survive unknown future requirements.
* The method requires shifting thinking from correctness to criticality.
* An architecture reaches a point of "criticality", where it becomes robust against unknown changes.

## Core Questions Addressed

* How can you develop architectures that survive unknown future requirements?
* How can you identify and use stressors to improve architecture?
* What is the scientific foundation of Residuality Theory?
* How does this approach differ from classical risk management?
* How can you tell whether youâ€™re on the right track with this method?
* How does the theory relate to other architectural approaches like YAGNI?

## Glossary of Key Terms

* **Stressor**: A factor that puts the architecture under stress and may cause it to break.
* **Criticality**: The state of an architecture in which it is robust against unknown changes.
* **Residue**: An architectural component that survives certain stressors.
* **Attractor States**: A limited number of possible states a complex system can assume.
* **Stressor Analysis**: A tool for systematically analyzing stressors.
* **Random Boolean Networks**: A mathematical model for describing complex systems.

Residuality Theory presents a novel, scientifically grounded approach to developing robust software architectures. It requires a fundamental shift in how we design architectures but promises systems that can better handle unknown future requirements.
